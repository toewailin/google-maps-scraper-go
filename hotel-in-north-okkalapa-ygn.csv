The hotel negotiated a flat fare taxi for me to the airport for 10,000 kyat, so I could safely spend out my remaining currency without being caught off guard.||On that note, there is a large shopping mall located 1.4 km up the road. It's called \""Terminal M,\"" and it has many restaurants/food courts, major retailers and most importantly a massive supermarket in the basement called \""Ocean Supermarket.\"" I walked to the supermarket from the hotel in about 15 mins (again, I'm a fast walker). It's safe to do so, just be aware you will be walking on the highway, so walk and cross the road with vigilance! I was able to spend out my remaining currency here, with great selection and prices!||Re: location, there are no food options nearby the hotel, so best be prepared for that! Unless you walk up to Terminal M, or come prepared with food for dinner at the hotel like I had done, you will find yourself in short supply. There are 2 small convenience stores across the street with basic supplies like water, crackers, cookies, instant noodles and other packaged foods which I couldn‚Äôt make out. The one convenience store directly adjacent has a big selection of wine! I was very happy to find wine in such an industrial area, and happily bought a bottle for a relaxing evening! Prices were reasonable.||Upon arrival at the hotel, I was greeted warmly by reception staff and check-in was swift. This was appreciated, since I had had a long travel day from Bagan!||My room was quite large, and very comfortable! Basic furniture such as a desk, chair, two bedside tables, and ample luggage storage (a large wooden bench and also a large wooden cabinet) were available! Air conditioning was strong, wifi signal was terrific (probably the best I've had in all of Myanmar so far), and the room was a welcome relief from the humidity. The room also came with a mini fridge (stocked with mini bar items such as water, a selection of sodas, and instant noodles), an electric kettle, 4-in-1 coffee (LOL, that's a first! Not sure what the 4th ingredient is!?), 2 coffee mugs, water glasses, 2 bottles of water with compliments, and 2 spoons.||Bathroom amenities included: 2 dental kits, 2 shower caps, bar soap, in shower shampoo and shower gel dispensers, and 2 combs. Toilet paper was in short supply, but staff were able to supply more when asked!||Shower and tap water were hot (perfect temperature) and water pressure was strong! Toilets were spotless!||Beds were super comfortable. Linens felt brand new and super clean. Pillows were the perfect firmness as was the mattress. Bedside lighting was also nice!||The room was equipped with flatscreen tv, with a few English channels to choose from - for one night, I was entertained enough! Sports channels namely, but there were also 2 movie channels in English as well.||The hotel has a cafe on the ground floor where breakfast is also served. It's called Holly Cafe! I didn't eat there, but prices looked reasonable. Breakfast buffet was fair, but not amazing, namely because I'm not one to enjoy Asian cuisine at breakfast (fried rice, noodles and greasy vegetables). I made do with what was on offer, as there were fried eggs, saut√©ed chicken breast with vegetables, fresh cut vegetables and fresh cut fruits available. Myanmar hotels mostly cater to Asian tastes, so one must be a bit flexible when traveling in this region! My only complaint would be the lack of availability of plain, no sugar added coffee/Nescaf√© (only 4-in-1 coffee packets were available), but I make it a point to carry my own in this region so I wasn't without.||Staff kindly allowed me to check-out an hour later, giving my time to regroup! They also helped me to remove the SIM card from my phone since I couldn't locate a paper clip or pin. Staff were extremely kind and helpful! ||Overall I enjoyed my stay at Holly Hotel! It was perfect for my transit needs, and allowed me a comfortable space to regroup, repack, and get organized for my next leg of travel! Excellent price to suit my budget also! But I also didn‚Äôt find accommodation in all of Myanmar to be terribly expensive either!||Thank you to all the staff for your kindness and hospitality! I loved Myanmar and will absolutely be back in the future!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Saothiha Htut"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV8KqBQ2mSbIhcBEccSxcNJqSW9tNc9EdjCEWtVKx5Vkk4wotFH=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""üëç Nice room, very tidy room and also in\nbathroom with toilet.\nüëç Near the highway station.\nüëç The room price is not expensive.\nüëç Air-conditioning is good."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN64PU6tD6HXPA12snSe4MsCVlyzP4tWrjJa7gl\u0026fid=0x0:0x650aee5bf9b2f242""],""When"":""2024-6-14""},{""Name"":""Gaurav Sancheti"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIk7vAPcfcQ5s5HNCwFF8fPbML5SGuLGwWvGOGkhfBqZLoTWA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The hotel staff is very polite and helpful.

The amenities feel like it is at least 3.5 star, but this hotel is actually just a 2 star.\n\nElectricity is always on 24/7 and the internet is pretty decent. I had zoom calls without much lag!\n\nOne downside though is every service here is EXPENSIVE. Laundry, food, breakfast are all above average priced. The only saving grace is that they give you free airport transfers. But I guess that is their business model, cheap brief layover stays.\n\nAlso, they tried to keep my passport safe for me in a folder. I didn't appreciate that at all, they should have brought me my passport back as soon as they didn't need it! I had to ask for it back...\n\nFinally, the location (aside from being close to the airport) is horrible. Only 2 restaurants are nearby and they are both average at best, with one being better because if pricing. No convinient stores at all, you can't buy snacks or any thing else you need like shampoo without taking a taxi to the middle of the city.\n\nOverall it was a good stay, I would comeback again a day before my next flight out of Myanmar.

As others have said, this hotel is very close (5 minutes) from the Yangon airport and very convenient for an overnight stay pre-flight. The pick up and drop off were prompt and all we could hope for. I booked a standard room, and we were first put in a 3rd floor (top floor) room. This room would have been unbearable. These top rooms sit under a slanted roof that appeared to be uninsulated since we could see light shining through in places. This meant that the ceiling of the room (the roof) was one large radiant heater. The finish-out in the room and bathroom was less than expected as well. When I called downstairs to say the heat was unbearable, they quickly moved us to an upgraded 2nd floor room that was perfectly cool and much more nicely finished out, so all was good. Food was good if not remarkable. The pool was dingy looking, so we passed on that. There is a fitness center in a building across the parking lot, but it was very warm inside. We walked the street outside the compound: Some interesting bits, but definitely a suburban slum and no sidewalks. My 4-star rating would probably be a 3.5, but the location and free shuttle service are excellent for airport access and the upgraded room was very nice. So, if like us, all you need is a clean, convenient and well-priced overnight stay near the airport, Grand Garden Hotel Yangon is the ticket.

It is close to Yangon International Airport, however you must take a taxi (experience in itself) to get there. There is a dirty and busy street in front of the hotel, with buses operating, but for a foreigner the system of the buses is almost ununderstandable. Alternatively you can use Yangon Circular Railway, a great attraction in itself, which can bring you to the Yangon main station in about one hour (the train rides very slowly, but shows you the real life of Myanmar). Wai Bar Gi station is within walking distance from the hotel (about 20 mins), however be prepared to walk through a very poor neighborhood and on soil roads. Aung Mingalar Bus Terminal is about 600 m from the hotel. The hotel itself has very simple rooms (just bed, table with chairs, small TV set and a very simple bathroom), any view was destroyed during my visit by a construction. The road is very noisy, so it is better to keep windows closed, there is quite loud air-conditioning. The \""bathroom\"" is just another empty room with shower and toilet, no frills, and during my stay there was no hot water in my room (maybe they could have probably fixed it if I would tell them, but it was OK in those hot and humid days). Bed is OK, linen is provided. There is a free wi-fi, but working only downstairs in a small lobby. Simple breakfast is included in the price. There are several small shops around, where you can buy water and something to eat, however do not put hygiene under a microscope... The whole neighborhood is very poor, but that is simply Myanmar. But the people are very nice and some of them in the hotel try to speak some words in English, however they are not used to foreign visitors very much. If you are looking for a very cheap accommodation not far from the airport (which was my intention), this hotel can serve you, but be prepared for a very spartan conditions.

On the good side, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. It is in a suburb next to Million Coins Restaurant. Across the street is a new soccer stadium.

There are four choices all of which include juice and powdered coffee.||||Questionable was the top floor where they did the laundry. I think there were two electric washers, but one lady was scrubbing towels on the roof floor. Another lady was ironing sheets. Washing was hung out in the air to dry. Standard stock in the bathrooms were packaged condoms, restocked when rooms were cleaned. Bathroom had a shower that soaked the entire bathroom floor since the small drain hole must have been too tiny. This is possibly similar to any third-world hotel which costs $28 per night.||||Worst was our confirmed reservation. We arrived at 1:00 am from a delayed flight. None of the three young men at the desk could speak English. Fortunately, our driver could speak Burmese. He told us that there were no rooms - sort of. Certainly they would not give us one. Possibly with condoms in the rooms caused our being sent away . . . who knows? We were given no help to find accommodations. Our driver (head of a school where we were teaching) allowed us to crash on a mat in his school office. Although a bit arrogant for me to say, no-one could speak English though the manager could somewhat communicate to us. ||||Depending on your expectations, it did not meet mine.

There was also an available lunch or dinner menu which was reasonable in price and the food was fairly good as well.  The room accommodations were reasonable and very similar to other hotels we have stayed at in the area. We did wind up moving rooms towards the end of our stay into a larger suite. This made our stay much more comfortable at the end. The location of the hotel is very easily accessible from the airport and to the north and east side of the city.The new Myanmar Plaza is only about 15 minutes taxi ride and was very convenient for shopping, additional dining, and to pick up bottled water or other sundries as needed. The staff did a very good job of helping us manage taxi rides and directions and were very helpful with their ability to speak English as well. During our stay there Internet connection was not available and did produce some challenges for us. There seems to be something lost in translation as to why the Internet was not working but it appeared that maybe because it was the slow season they had disconnected the Internet because of the cost and the low number of visitors during our stay. Overall, we had a very reasonable stay and always looked forward to getting back to the hotel at the end of the day after we had been out and about. Despite some of the challenges with the Internet, the staff was very helpful and we may consider staying there again.

The hotel is situated on the banks of Ngammoeyeik Creek, a tidal tributary to Yangon River in otherwise rather poor-looking surroundings. Unless you intend to rough it out, eating places that will fit the average tourist's basic needs are rare around the hotel. There is a bakery shop with cafe at the beginning of U Wisara Road (some 2.5km away). It is very popular among locals and serves decent food for a snack. For a proper meal you may want to move closer to town. Getting a taxi is not difficult at any time because for some reason there are plenty of taxis driving along U Wisara Road. Apart from the remote location (in relation to downtown Yangon), the other drawback of this hotel were that noise travelled easily along its corridors and through the light doors. If your stay coincides with that of a Korean or Chinese travel group, chances are that light sleepers will have to wake up at the same time. During the time of our stay, there was work being done in the environs of the hotel adding further to the noise level. ||Breakfast was included and included a standard selection of fruit, eggs, toast, cake, fruit punch (called ‚Äújuice‚Äù), congee and some warm dishes etc. ||In conclusion: Similar to Sri Lanka after the end of the civil war, Myanmar‚Äôs hospitality industry went off the rails when it benefited from a sudden swelling of tourist arrivals after the opening of the country some three years ago. Prices for accommodation have more than doubled. They may not be exorbitantly high but I like to compare all deals with what you get in Thailand because it is the place where you get the best value-for-money if you look for it and most people can relate to this popular destination. Everything I have come across this trip, cannot remotely compare with what you get in Thailand for the same price."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Chuck Huckaby"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpbWZRZuxWnvS4180mBywsGxRjQ1la5FKeg3UQGuRJcFIq8GUNxg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Just a short ride from the new Yangon International Airport, the Royal Golden View is a fine hotel with free breakfast.

As Yangon hotels goes it's pretty good for the price. You can spend a lot more and get the same thing. Myanmar has only been \""open\"" for a few years and so they still do some annoying things the \""closed\"" way, however, it is getting better. But if you are expecting something like you would get in BKK or HKG or SIN then you'll be disappointed. However, all in all, this is the best for the price I've stayed at in YNG in my history there going back 9 years.||||Good Points||1. Clean. Rooms and hallways are clean and well lit.||2. Staff is friendly, however, is hampered by the rules laid down by someone who is not on the premises. The staff has no authority to do anything on their own.||3. GREAT hot water showers. Each room has its own HW heater. Good volume, clean water, well heated.||4. GREAT bathrooms. New, clean. It is a \""wet\"" bathroom but it is so much better than anything you are likely to get anywhere else outside of YNG. Getting back to this shower after a week elsewhere was the highlight of my trip.||5. Good Price. I paid $65 USD Cash for double occupancy. You must have cash and it must be cash that is in good shape. No marks. No tears. No dirt. They will simply refuse to accept anything that is not 95% perfect, so carry clean bills.||6. Fridge in the room. Good size TV. Air conditioning. Decent bed. Good sheets. Clean sheets. Great pillows. Good lighting in the room. Recessed LED ceiling lights. Well lit.||||Before I get to the Not So Good points. I did not eat at the hotel. I did not order any food there. I did not go to the restaurant. ||||Not So Good:||1. The AC in the rooms is VERY diverse depending on what room you get. We rejected 2 or 3 rooms before settling on one where the AC worked well. They will tell you, \""wait 20 minutes and it will get cool\"".  So wait and se what happens.||2. The southwest facing rooms (front) are into the sun most of the day. The inside of the windows are so hot you can't touch them. The second floor is worse. The heat coming into the room from the balcony door, or window or even through the wall is amazing. It will make these rooms 20 degrees hotter then the other side of the hotel. If you have to have a SW facing room take the ground floor as the trees outside provide a bit of shade. However, the lobby noise may get to you.||3. Noisy. There are signs up all over the hallways asking people to be quiet. The walls are not insulated and are all cement or tile and it echoes around the place. Wear earplugs to bed.||4. Cash. You must have USD cash and it must be clean. If you say, \""This is all I have.\"" They still will not take a marked or barely worn or torn bill. The people at the desk are simply following orders and have no discretion in the matter. The boss will take it out of their pay if they take your bill.||5. Out of the way. The hotel is not near much of anything. Which is fine for me but may be bad if you are looking for shopping or restaurants.||6. English. Their English is fine if everything goes well, but if you have a problem or require something more than standard English they will struggle. However, they are very pleasant and look like they understand.||7. Internet is sketchy and slow and erratic.||||All in all it is the best for the price that I have found in Yangon so far. If you get a room where the AC works on the Northeast side, and you have been to the grocery store for your food, you can have a nice stay and get clean."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

The large building is quite unique with many rooms within. The building is spartan and decent within. The rooms are clean but spartan. Although there is air conditioning, be prepared for a noisy night of air con noise from the old units. The toilet is big but very rudimentary. Expect power failures and the flush not working. However, if you have basic plumbing skills, that could easily be fixed rather than calling on the reception. You may have a language barrier!! Beds and toilets are really retro, so are the light fixtures. There is a small TV set with many channels. If you enjoy old Korean dramas dubbed in the local vernacular, then it's will be entertainment!! Oh yes, no towels or soap is provided. Bring your own towels, toiletries, and yes your own toilet paper. Also, no drinking water is provided. If you need any of these, these have to be paid for I guess. Breakfast is very rustic with a piece of plain bread with a fired egg. Coffee comes in a 3-1 satchet. So bring your own food to supplement!! There is supposed to be wifi in a small corner of the lobby. But don't count on that. There is never a connection when I was there. So you will really enjoy the real world without the lure of the internet!! The surrounding buildings are a sight to behold!! It's a walk back to the past with very old buildings. Enjoy the local culture and the endless heavy traffic as you try to cross the 6 lanes road!! No pedestrian crossing unfortunately. Make sure you buy travel insurance before you attempt to cross the road!! There are small Internet caf√©s nearby and a new but small shopping mall. To enter the mall, you have to pass through a metal detector gate!! There is a small but nice cafe within walking distance which sells decent food!!

Haben Low Season Preis bekommen (High Season ist hier Februar, da Myanmar da Schulferien hat)|Chaung Tah (siehe separate Bewertung) ist ein Urlaubsort f√ºr die Einheimischen und Chinesische Touristen. ||Unserem Wunsch auf h√∂herer Etage ein Zimmer zu bekommen (3 St√∂ckig), wurde entsprochen. |Die Sauberkeit m√ºssen wir bem√§ngeln. Handt√ºcher seeehr fleckig (wirklich grenzwertig) und Bettw√§sche auch. Die Decke ist nur eine zwischen 2 Bettlaken (zu allen Seiten offen) gepackte L√∂sung. Bett war gut. Matratze h3, das ist ok. ||In dem Geb√§ude √ºber der Rezeption wird gebaut, das h√∂rt man aber nur am Tag. Nachts wurden wir nicht gest√∂rt. ||Das Personal war stets bem√ºht und jedem Wunsch den wir √§u√üerten wurde nach M√∂glichkeiten entsprochen, wenn es auch oft seine Zeit brauchte mit H√§nden und F√º√üen zu erkl√§ren was man wollte, da Englisch in dieser Gegend kaum einer versteht oder spricht. Speisekarten und Beschilderungen sind max. auf Chinesisch oder nur Burmesisch. Sehr wenige weisen sie in Englisch aus. Wir waren hier echte Exoten als ‚ÄûFraktion Wei√übrot‚Äú :-D||Wifi.. welches Wifi? Aktuell buhlen wohl noch die Anbieter um die Leitungen. Wifi funktionierte 98% der Zeit gar nicht. W√ºrde wohl in einem Monat nicht mehr so sein. Auch Chaung Tah modernisiert erst seit kurzem... hier wird noch viel passieren bez√ºglich Hotel Angebot in den n√§chsten Jahren. Vll gibts ja auch irgendwann mal einen richtigen kleinen Supermarkt. ||Fr√ºhst√ºck haben wir einmal mitgemacht. 6:30-9 ist uns einfach zu zeitig im Urlaub Auswahl auf Einheimische und Chinesische G√§ste abgestimmt. Die Omlett Station ist sehr unscheinbar und haben wir fast √ºbersehen (war aber unsere Rettung). Fr√ºchte nur Melone und Ananas (Melone schmeckte fischig)|Zu 97% alles herzhaft und zu chinesisch. Veggies haben hier ein dezentes Problem am Buffett ;)|Wem das Fr√ºhst√ºck wie uns zu fr√ºh ist, geht schr√§g gegen√ºber in das ‚ÄûHappy Chaung Tha Motel \u0026 Restaurant‚Äú -das Spanish Omelett und das normale Omlette (mit Tomate und Zwiebeln auf Wunsch), sowie die Fresh Fruit Juice und der Pancake waren sehr gut und machten gut satt. Preise super! (1-2‚Ç¨, also 1500-3000ks)||Die Preise in den umliegenden Restaurants sind ebenfalls sehr g√ºnstig :)|Nur bietet nicht jeder die Fr√ºhst√ºcks Sachen an. Hier kann man sich zum Mittag- und Abendessen √ºberall mal durchprobieren. ||Am Pool im Hotel: Bikini Verbot. |Frauen m√ºssen sich wie in Myanmar √ºblich mit l√§ngerer Shorts und minimum Tshirt bekleiden, wenn der Pool Bereich (direkt vor der Lobby) genutzt werden m√∂chte. M√§nner normal mit Shorts. Als emanzipiert gepr√§gte Gesellschaft, greifen wir uns bei sehr ‚Äûgro√üen K√∂rpern‚Äú der Chinesischen Touristen am Pool, an den Kopf, da uns der Sinn fern liegt, wenn die M√§nner mehr Oberweite und viel weniger √Ñsthetik aufweisen als all die Damen (...)|Am Strand ist Bikini ok/erlaubt aber dieser l√§dt nicht dazu ein (siehe Chaung Tha Bewertung)|Praktiziert hier auch keiner. | |Der Lobby und Fr√ºhst√ºcksbereich ist offen und nicht so sch√∂n gestaltet. Hat was von einer kahlen Kantine. Hier k√∂nnte mehr Flair durch Myanmar Style herrschen. ||Einen Safe bekamen wir auf Nachfrage. ||Mini Bar (K√ºhlschrank mit Getr√§nken und guten Preisen) vorhanden. ||Balkon der Zimmer recht gro√ü. T√ºr schlie√üt nicht dicht. Eventuell Moskitos. |Das Bad der Deluxe Zimmer ist klein. Die Dusche hat keinen Vorhang und es wird immer alles nass = Nasszelle||Strom gibt es nur von 6-18 Uhr und von 13-16 Uhr|Wenn man das wei√ü, l√§dt man Kamera, Handy und Co √ºber Nacht und l√§sst die Klima am besten bis zum Morgen laufen, damit es bis 9 Uhr noch angenehm zum schlafen ist. ||Von 15:3-16:30 gibt es ein mini Buffet mit Chinesischen Tee und Kaffee sowie Chinesischer Suppe. Dem konnten wir gar nichts abgewinnen aber fanden wir eine sch√∂ne Grundidee. ||T√ºren der Zimmer unm√∂glich leise zu schlie√üen :(|Knallt sehr! Vor allem morgens. ||Beleuchtung im Zimmer f√ºr gem√ºtliches Licht am Abend nicht vorhanden. Eine simple kleine Leuchte auf dem Nachtisch oder in einer Ecke fehlt.||Im M√§rz/April ist es hier Nachts warm aber sonst zb Jan und Feb wird es doch sehr frisch Abends und eine d√ºnnes J√§ckchen und eine lange d√ºnne Stoffhose sind zu empfehlen, sonst friert man zu sp√§ter Stunde im Restaurant oder beim  Bummeln. Die Einheimisch haben hier Abends und Nachts sogar dicke Wollm√ºtzen auf und stellen weise Daunenjacken an aber f√ºr sie ist es auch Winter. Fanden wir witzig anzusehen, da wir aus Dtl noch ganz andere Temp. gew√∂hnt sind. |||||Fazit: simple, relativ h√ºbsche Zimmer. Bad sagt uns leider nicht zu und die Sauberkeit war mir nix... Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit!|Zufrieden waren wir hier aber in Summe der einzelnen Punkte nicht. Absoluter Durchschnitt. |"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kyaw Thwin Tun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU03n_iTwbiBv-dVcB2Gik9BypJwV9iVOhf3awk7XYP0_J-CKeu=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""·Äû·Ä¨·Äö·Ä¨·Äú·Äæ·Äï ·Äê·Ä≠·Äê·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä∫·Ä°·Ä±·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏\n·Äù·Äî·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äô·Äæ·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫\n·ÄÖ·Äª·Ä±·Ä∏·Äî·Äæ·ÄØ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äû·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∑·Äê·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äû·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏ ·Äû·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∑·Äõ·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""·Äû·Ä∞·Äõ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∫ ·Äû·Ä∞·Äõ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∫"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFvb_LE-bJTKbKhvyQDVUjYep79Q-tGgR4SO8fg5SuiGVTE3Q=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":"""",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ko Pyit"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVemd-IXhvc2z35LHFbhtgp2WGyQ_lrA0FfwklC5LooseTw405H=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":"""",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

The beds are extremely comfortable with duvets and white linen and fresh towels are provided daily. The bathroom has a walk-in shower and there is always plenty of hot water. Staff are delightful and extremely helpful and the manager Zayar is always eager to oblige.

The hotel is only a few minutes drive from the airport and pickups can be arranged for just 5000 kyats (about $4) which saves you haggling with local taxi drivers. ||I had been staying at another nearby hotel which I have used for years but standards were declining so moved to Hotel 9 Mile on the recommendation of a local friend.

It is exactly located in the small lane,which is connected to main road. So basically you can rest peacefully and quietly. Overview of hotel is average as old furnitures and bedding are used. Rooms are decorated with simple tiles but the room i was given was quite spacious and great point was that small balcony was attached to my room. Small mini fridge as per normal and small safe box,which was not functioning unfortunately were provided. There was small little tv with 3 channels ridiculously. Breakfast were served with two varieties, American breakfast and Korean breakfast. I tried American and it was simple dish and nothing special. I noticed i was the only non-korean in the dinning room and whole hotel i guess. Hence, this hotel can be considered as Korean hotel. There is SPA within hotel compound and i would say that is the only plus for this hotel. You should try the SPA though but don't get ur expectation too high on its decorations. So, for my point of review, i would rate this hotel as follows:|Price: 2.5/5|Service: 4/5|Room : 2.5/5|Breakfast : 2/5|Location : 4/5 ( as closer to airport and shopping mall nearby)|SPA :3.5/5|Over all : 3/5"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Stuart K"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QeFH6dzZjd_ZFLhXHZKibEzXEy8hWzFB4Qa7PutLe3CnO2G7yVfjd4VSabiCQwQYo5W-g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""The hotel is very new.

Even the kimchee was true, original Korean made.||||The bed, like all of Myanmar, is hard.  But, I got used to it as we stayed at 7 hotels throughout our travel from 3* to 5*.||||I went to the Spa and had an 75 min massage.  The girls are quite young.....16-19 year olds.  The massage is a Thai style massage where they would manipulate your back and go through all kinds of contortions.  The beds are laid out very close to each other so you could hear the next person beside you.  It was only 10,000 which is about $12.00 US.  Amazing.  No wonder it is a very popular place.||||The staff is very friendly, service oriented and on the ball.  I paid $45 US for the night and was a happy camper. Maybe my price was good because it was a referral. Would definitely return here if we ever come back to Myanmar.  All in all a very satisfying stay.  Simple and detail oriented.

We chose your hotel after carefully comparing reviews and services from other options, but unfortunately, the experience fell short of our expectations and what the reviews suggested.\n\nFirstly, we called ahead at noon to inquire about early check-in but were told it wasn‚Äôt possible. We understand that early check-in is subject to availability, but this was disappointing. We checked in at 2 p.m. as directed.\n\nDuring the check-in process, the reception team did not thoroughly verify our booking details. They requested full payment upfront despite our prior payment of half the charges via Kpay. We had to remind them to recheck the information, which was frustrating and could have easily been avoided with better attention to detail.\n\nSecondly, our room was not ready upon arrival, even though we had informed the reception in advance of our arrival time. When escorted to the room, the staff knocked before entering, which raised concerns about whether they were unsure if the room was properly assigned to us. Additionally, the key card provided didn‚Äôt work, leaving us waiting outside for an extended period. The staff eventually opened the room with a master key but left us with the malfunctioning card instead of replacing it with a functional one. This was not only inconvenient but also unprofessional.\n\nThe state of the room itself was also disappointing. The bed was not properly organized, and the decorative pillows and blanket shown in your promotional photos were haphazardly stored in the wardrobe rather than being arranged on the bed. This lack of attention to detail made us question whether the room had been properly cleaned after the last guest‚Äôs stay. The staff member assisting us also did not offer any information about the facilities, and their tone and demeanor were far from what one would expect from hospitality staff. We felt disrespected and unwelcome.\n\nLastly, communication between staff was noticeably poor. Upon leaving for dinner, we informed the reception about the faulty key card and handed it over for replacement. However, when we returned, the staff on duty seemed unaware of the situation and even questioned whether we had handed in the key at all. This clear lack of communication between shifts added to our dissatisfaction.\n\nOverall,  the service we received was far from the standard we anticipated, and we hope these issues will be addressed for future guests."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Pearl Su"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKmPkagE-Z23PA_7GpkkzZQ94VuUT3WYlPp5b7EJRlt0Efunw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""It is located inside of the alley.

The club lounge is also not worth it because no one buys it and as a result, they come up with sushi looking pizza menu."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOFg5HM9_qmdMpBs-YSrfnw_W32qKQrU4ROnDgI\u0026fid=0x0:0x1ce0d39a47ca647c""],""When"":""2025-2-16""},{""Name"":""aung ko ko Win"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKSLsCXVULCVlKDvsIVUBinTNszcYRk6xB_IHPuznv_6kk2Hmc=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I recently had the pleasure of enjoying tea time at the Lotte Hotel and it was quite the experience.

The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained.

When I talked to the manager he made heaps of excuses. He tried to tell me the wifi situation was hard for them too... He talked about the situation in their country‚Ä¶ I feel he's not being honest. How can they run their business if they can't load a web page each evening? It might be Burma, but that's a bit too much to believe. We're staying for 2 weeks!\nThe only plus was the good and complimentary laundry service. (it should be complementary too! We're paying a lot and not getting much value for money). I since discover that was a special deal for us, it's not usually complimentary.\nThe only reason we returned here is the location is suitable for us. But there's other hotels nearby and we're going to try another one. I hope I don't have to stay here again.\nI feel like the management, and therefore the staff, are not honest ) (The staff were lovely, friendly and helpful, but they have to do what the management says. They have to follow the rules.)\nThe hotel prefers you to pay in USD instead of local money (kyat), and they make the exchange rate heavily in their favour. When the kyat is down, it should be a cheaper USD price, but they never adjust. More dishonesty."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Thant Z"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QeCck1CfANpZm9bBk3PHtP97Kh9k25HZfvq9yAWlN3BaIyjSHUPEfWkhAJmuYiJsH-_6g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""Very attentive service and very well maintained facility.

We arrived in Yangon early in the morning after a 9 hour bus ride from Bagan. The receptionist greeted us and was able to check us in, in no time. She gave us orange juice as refreshments afterwards she hand us our room key and wifi password. Once we're settled in the room we immediately check if the wifi is working but both our phones aren't able to connect so we went down to the receptionist and have it checked. She eventually rebooted the router and that solved the problem so in case you encounter the same problem when you get there just ask the receptionist to turn the router on and off to save time since they don't have any IT guy around to fix it. They have quite a lot of options for breakfast especially if you're an early bird and the dining room is nice compared to other hotels we've stayed at it is very accessible too it's just located beside the reception area or if you don't want to get pass reception there's a door on the far right side of the elevator at the ground level if you just went down from your room. Our room is clean and have large windows with views of houses and buildings. This hotel is situated on the quiet side of Yangon beside a Buddhist Monastery that's why we had a real good sleep. There's a 24 hour lift and no power outages, thank God. There's no iron/ironing board available to rent but the receptionist offered someone to have my clothes ironed for free she asked some guy to come up to pick up and deliver my clothes which is okay though I'd prefer to do it myself if possible. I just noticed that Internet in Myanmar is not very fast so don't expect a lot when it comes to that. They arranged a taxi to take us to the airport the next day but it is not a free service offered by the hotel. They do not have airport pick up and drop off fyi.

But it is located across the street from a decent sized super market (Orange Market) and there's a lot of street food to try at night in the area.||One negative was that some days, I did come back to my room at night to find a lizard crawling on the wall. There were a few days when I woke up to find worms on the bathroom floor, which were cleaned up during the day time.||One thing I would advise though, is not to leave cash in the room. I left $50 in cash by accident in a visible place inside an empty bag, and returned later that night to only find $40. The reason why I did not dock any points for this though is because I immediately let the management know, and the manager immediately called a meeting with all his employees to found out what happened. When he couldn't figure out who it was, he gave me $10 from his own pocket, which I refused, but he insisted.
