Like they got limited varieties of food and most are cooked with too much oil which wasn't really good. The wifi was really TERRIBLE, one of the reasons why I had to change hotel. I also noticed like most taxi drivers in the city |Always have trouble locating the hotel, like in 3 different occasions the cabbies had to call the hotel for direction or some even got lost completely trying to find the hotel.|But other than this few setbacks at the hotel, I love the cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms are big and the staffs are super friendly and nice.

We checked-in around 3PM. Says you can check-in starting at 2PM. But when we arrived, the room wasn't quite ready yet. They were still fixing the water heater. They informed us that we'll be able to use hot water by night-time. The Side Table and Stools weren't even arranged properly when we arrived. We specifically requested the lake view room but was allocated at the 5th floor where the lake can't be seen as it's covered by trees. Still we get the view of Shwedagon Pagoda though. The room was hot, humid and a bit dusty when we checked in. Bed sheets are stained in some places but we didn't complain. What I was disgusted most by is the mold in Shower Curtains. Yuck! And hair remains in the bathtub and floor near the bed. At night, I turned on hot water and all I got was air, rusted brown water and cold water. I called them to check and they came in claiming the water is usable and is warm. It wasn't. Don't let me start with the room key card... Works 1 out of 30 tries. They came to change batteries both in the evening and the next morning. Every time we get out of the room we get locked out even though we have the key card with us. The only good thing was the tasty breakfast with a wide variety to choose from. Even for breakfast, the dining room arrangement sucked. They put two extra tables and chairs close to the buffet table and we have to tuck through these to get the food. Ugh... And they rang the doorbell at 7 AM mistakenly with the next room who were to check-out that morning. Didn't even say they were sorry for the interruption. We were given breakfast tickets but when we arrived at the dining room, no one was there to collect it so we left these tickets on the table after we were done eating. Guess what? They called us at 9AM and said it was the last call for breakfast. Good that they remind us for Breakfast, bad that they suck at who has finished eating and who have not. Overall, it seems overrated and overpriced compared to other hotels in town. Maybe they treat us locals differently from foreigners, not sure about that, as the room rates for locals and foreigners are different. But I think, for the same price, there are many hotels out there that give better service and facilities than those provided here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTjv-D6zKesrZz3a9TCruPYLhsrV5_JvBM9upK\u0026fid=0x0:0xf4763ad7a8ba89c5""],""When"":""2023-6-3""}]",

The room is very well designed – I especially liked the direct usb ports provided. Killed a couple of mosquitoes in the room, and my hot water shower takes a couple minutes to heat up. Faint KTV music can be heard through room insulation on weekend nights.

There was also no construction when I was there. My room is huge (and ceiling high), the television is so far away (8-10m) from my bed I have problem seeing the details. In contrast my hotel room in the city centre was so small that the TV is mounted like 80cm from the bed and they have to put it near the ceiling to increase the distance. The rooms are very well furnished (best value for money IMHO) and bigger than the family room that I had booked at the nearby Crystal Palace Hotel. It is a modern hotel with card entry. If you stay at the hotel you get a 20% discount at the Spa and the ONLY treatment I would recommend is the traditional massage at 10,000 kyat before discount. The Monalisa Restaurant (Level 1) is actually excellent and reasonably priced that I ended having dinner there every night. The breakfast is not excellent but quite good. There is actually an omelette counter so you can have you eggs done in any way but I did not see any eggs swimming in grease.||While the Wifi is not great, the signal is relatively strong and it is actually better than most hotels in Myanmar. Internet speed is not fast in the whole country and may break off.||Having stayed at various locations in Yangon, I can say this hotel is very centrally located. You can walk to visit Chauk Htat Gyi and Nga Htat Gyi Pagodas and be back within 2 hours without rushing. Shwedagon is also within walking distance.Downtown and Kandawgyi Lake are also not far away.  ||The best thing about this hotel is the hot water. You get very hot water very fast, better than some 5 star hotels.||Try not to venture to the basement as it is a \""Love Tunnel\"" mostly for the local businessmen. The hotel staff is helpful, friendly and professional. Highly recommended, it is unbeatable at the price I paid. The only negative about this hotel is that there are no shops, shopping centres or amenities nearby. There is a diesel generator planted at the entrance of the hotel so any electrical outages are very short."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Probably not best location if you want a week here, but for us it was ideal. (We stayed in March, but Trip Advisor is playing up and keeps defaulting to todays date!)"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

I have to greet good morning first.\n\nRoom/ 3 Stars - made a reservation with a confirmation of Premier room with king bed size in advance but they gave me twin joint bed, normally I won’t have any problem either King or twins Zipped bed however under the twin zipped bed, they placed normal sponge sheets which very hot and uncomfortable to sleep on. When I complained they said it was their standard.\n\nRoom Cleanliness/ 2 stars - a lot of previous guests hair (all type of hair) in under the floor and a lot of dust on the table. Extra pillow also very dirty, there was still on spot of stained on pillow, Look like a stained of human sperm.\n\nWhen I called Front office staff and show him how bad the room was arranged, they finally switch with another but have to wait 3 more hours to be able to move to new room.

Also still have hair on the floor for a newly clean room.\n\nBreakfast/ 3 Stars - normal, not much choice.\n\nBellman - leaked of concentration.

It was next door in a busy restaurant. There is a choice of 4 set menus with no changes allowed (it is not a buffet). Most hotels (every one we have stayed at in Yangon) have a buffet. The restaurant wouldn't even give us water, only tea or coffee (which I doubt is from filtered water). The water at the hotel is turbid (a light brown color), and I imagine that is what you get with the tea/coffee.||We brought our own bottled every morning which was not a problem.||I would give details about the number of flies in the restaurant, but suffice it to say that if you dont like flies buzzing everywhere, you might want to avoid the place.||The location (walking distance to the lake) was ok.

In fact the entire hotel is beautifully decorated with expensive interior design, plush furniture , deeply padded carpeting and expensive fittings.\n\nMy room is beautifully decorated with quality linens, a great mattress, and comfortable traditional- style furniture.

Partly because it's the low season and very hot. But also tourists are absent because of the political situation in Myanmar.\n\nA military coup has caused great instability and there is fighting raging throughout the country, although Rangoon itself seems free of violence.\n\nSo there is only The Veranda bar restaurant open for drinks and dining and I have only seen one other hotel guest when I went there.\n\nThe ATM was out of order when I went to use it. Other services the hotel used to offer are no longer available due to the lack of guests, and certain floors of the hotel have apparently been sealed closed.\n\nThe district surrounding the hotel did not seem safe to walk at night and this was confirmed to me by hotel staff.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is just so so, and not of a wide variety. However there are delicious jams, yoghurts, and The Omelette station provides nice tasty omelettes.

The rooms are clean and maintained well. They even have an ATM in the lobby. There is a 24hour CityMart (local supermarket) nearby. Since the hotel is on the main road, you can easily get Grab (like Uber car sharing service) and go around the city.\n\nDo read my previous review below:\n\n*****************************\nOld review from 2017 below:\n\nWe stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in the Superior twin room and 2 nights in the Junior Suite B with Bathtub. As most of the reviews have already mentioned,  choose the rooms towards the back of the hotel (away from the road) and preferably to the right (facing east), these rooms have a better view and also you will get a glimpse of the rising sun. The hotel's buffet breakfast is great and each day they have a special local cuisine. This, in my opinion, would be a very safe way to try out the local dishes. The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained. The only problem is  that the doors do not appear to be sound proof and could be a problem if there are a lot of guests moving in-and-out of their rooms. TIP: There is a City Mart outlet straight down the road, about 15mins walk. There is a hospital nearby. There are some great food places in about 15mins walk.

The rooms are spacious and tidy, with a practical and clean bathroom, and a large wardrobe for storing clothes. The security is excellent, and the atmosphere is pleasant and tranquil, featuring pools on the terrace.\n\nFood: The dining is excellent and very reasonably priced.\n\nI’m genuinely surprised because I’ve tried to find a flaw but haven’t been able to.\n\nBefore this hotel, I stayed at a typical resort where the crowds, noise, and activities overwhelm any sense of tranquility. Upon arriving here, I quickly felt at home, relaxed, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be in a hotel that combines the warmth of a cozy establishment with the comfort and decor of a high-end hotel.\n\nI highly recommend it.

The pool area is nice but looks a bit like an oasis in a desert. There is huge space around the pool that is used for functions. My purpose for booking this hotel was for the use of the gym and pool before a late night flight the day after. I wanted to spend my last day chilling by the pool but there was indeed a poolside funtion, which meant the pool was closed. I explained my purpose for booking to the manager and he was understanding and allowed me to swim while the staff were preping the event. I am very pleased with his understanding of this situation.

The website pictures look nice but are either photoshopped or so old that they no longer are accurate.  The walls are dirty and covered in the blood of many dead mosquitoes.  The bathrooms used to have white grout, but now are black with mildew.  -2 rating for horribly accurate pictures.  Second, the hotel does nothing for mosquito control.  I stayed in multiple hotels throughout Myanmar and every hotel was proactive at controlling the mosquitoes.  This place does nothing and the rooms were filled with them.

We got the entire floor (two rooms), and one of the rooms smelled of cigarette smoke.  -1 rating for that.  +1 rating as the staff seemed nice, the breakfast was decent, and location was good.

The first hotel I booked at $20 per night was an absolute dive. I got out of there as quickly as I could! Walked into Hotel Bond having checked it out online, yes it was a higher price, but worth every penny. The staff were so welcoming when I turned up at 8 in the morning, got me settled into a room and even invited me to have breakfast. The staff carried my suitcase up the stairs and even with the shared bathroom, i never saw the other guest sharing the bathroom so there was no conflict there. The bathroom was excellent with a rainforest shower and a smaller shower head. My suggestions here would be to get some bigger shampoo and shower gel bottles, the tiny individual ones are a waste of plastic and in this case space given that it is a shared bathroom. Putting some floor mats for the bathroom would also be a good idea, 2-3 so each room can have their own.||The room was small but very comfortable and clean.||The breakfast was decent and the daily noodle dish was always vegetable only which is just perfect!||My only other recommendation would be large water refills. Whilst having large water bottles as well as small is a big step above most hotels, I would prefer to use no plastic at all. When I asked the guy at the desk where I might refill my bottle, he said he didn't know and to maybe try a pagoda, when I walked out the door it was less than 30 seconds before I saw that there are water tanks on the street all over the place and these are for anyone to use! Hurrah! Still it would be great if the hotel included water refills in their breakfast room."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Compared to ten months ago, the apartments have gotten a lot of wear and tear. Little things aren't working like the AC remote, the door lock was missing batteries, the water heater switch was gone. You can tell the unit isn't cleaned completely. This apt building is still pretty new but it's already gone downhill. I can imagine in a year or two it will be in really bad condition.\n\nAnother thing is that when I tried to check in they claimed I paid too low a rate on Agoda so they would not honor my reservation. They said they had told Agoda but I never received any cancellation. It's completely wrong to force guests to come to your hotel and then tell them they cannot check in. They cld have cancelled my booking or at least sent a message thru Agoda. After an hour of waiting Agoda finally agreed to cover the price difference but I wldn't trust booking this place as they don't seem to know what they are doing with online bookings. If they want 40usd or more a night for this place I don't think it's good value as you can get a 4 star hotel for that much in Yangon.\n\nOther than these issues, it's in a good location, there are two small shops downstairs to buy water and a couple restaurants I didn't try. It's in a development of many new apt buildings but most are unoccupied.

The hotel looks like a 3 star hotel and we had some doubts when we went into the hotel lounge. Reaching the bar on top of level 12, we were greeted by a rather bare large rooftop with chairs and tables placed loosely. The bar is literally two simple tables with different alcohol bottles displayed on it. We didn't have much hope. But the view was great and we had a good view of the padoga and full moon, which was really nice. Ordered a mojito and it was not bad at all. In other countries, this will probably get two or three stars from me but given that it is in myanmar, I think the place deserves 4 stars. Just remember that this is still a relatively new emerging market and places are still not fully commercialize yet, which is the main point. Sit back, enjoy the view, sip the cocktail which is only usd2.5, and relax. I'm sure one day, this bar will go through dramatic transformation into a high end bar with proper chairs, deco and expensive cocktails but I truly like it the way it is now.

When you get to the roof, you will inevitably see a quiet place with few patrons and several attentive servers.  You will have a great view of Shwedagon Pagoda and all of downtown Yangon.  The place isn't really glitzy but it has a definite charm, perhaps as a recognition of quieter times in Yangon.  It is a must visit in Yangon.

In nearly 3 weeks in myanmar we stayed in various places, all of which we found great, even very cheap backpackers hostels with no warm water or mirror in the room. However, we do think you should get what you pay for and this place just doesn't make sense. ||positive things first: the hotel is well located, near some nice restaurants and cafes and not far from the shwedagon pagoda. And the wifi works well. ||Other than that, it really sucked. Was by far and away the worst hotel we stayed in, in an almost 3 week trip to Myanmar - and the most expensive!! (Slightly surpassing even a beach front bungalow at Ngapali!)||The hotel and its furniture and equipment are very very old with some ridiculous features, like none of the room or bathroom lights working unless the main light is on (which makes it hard when one person is awake and the other isn't), and an almost cute built- in radio set from the 70s at the very latest! ||bad smell in the room (of smoking, to which a bellboy was sent to spray some anti-odor all over the room...) and in the hallways (of ginger cooking or something like that) - both topped with a lingering scent of mold. Bath was uninviting to say the least. ||My friend came in late and accidentally  walked into a different room to discover that the key worked!! After which she tried a few more and apparently the magic key opened all the rooms she tried. Didn't really matter because the hotel was empty except for us - and rightfully so.||The reason we picked this hotel was because of the so-called rooftop bar, which turned out to be a poor guy standing in front of a small reception table stocked with some alcohol bottles,  and an entirely unimpressive view. Yes, you can see the Shwedagon pagoda but aside from that not much more. ||We know there is a supply-demand problem in Yangon which makes for a situation in which hotels don't need to try very hard and still have a steady flow of clients.

However, upon arrival, I was given a smoking room with a strong odor and a quilt cover stained with bright yellow urine marks. To make matters worse, the bathroom amenities were only set up for one person. When I requested additional items, the staff insisted that my booking was for a single guest. I had to show them proof from both my booking confirmation and the Trip.com request form before they only gave one additional toothbrush.Regarding non-smoking room, I again raised my concerns in the mid-afternoon, the receptionist informed me at around 8:30 PM that they could move me to another non-smoking room which I kindly declined because I dont have time to pack again as I am have other business meetings in that evening. Due to the overwhelming smoke smell and the unacceptable hygiene condition of the bedsheets, I was unable to sleep all night.As for the morning breakfast, I was once again disappointed by the poor service. I ordered an egg, but it was poorly prepared—its appearance was unappetising, almost resembling vomit. To make matters worse, when the restaurant staff brought it over, liquid from the eggs was dripping through their hands and onto the floor. It was extremely unhygienic and unacceptable.To be honest, I was deeply disappointed by the hotel’s failure to maintain even basic standards of professionalism and hygiene, let alone the expectations of a four-star establishment.I sincerely hope the hotel improves its professionalism and, most importantly, its basic hygiene.

And all of the sudden it was hard to breath and I could not see much of the sitting area because the whole room was filled with smoke!  I quickly grabbed the sleeping baby, ran out of the room upstairs to the reception area to ask what was wrong!  With very limited English the owner later managed to tell me that it was the regular Sunday night mosquito fumigation and somehow the fumes got into our room.||||He knew about it and yet did nothing to warn us, knowing full well that we checked in with a small baby.||||Not acceptable.||||||2) Room change||Understandably I was very worried about the toxicity of the fumes and our baby, requested that we change room to another one that's the same size and setup.  There was only one tripple room, all other rooms were smaller which meant a downgrade, but the owner refused to give a discount even if we downgrade to a smaller room to avoid the smoke.||We ended up having to wait until the smoke cleared, coming back to and sleeping in the same room that night.||||Such welcoming event on our first night.  It was an extremely stressful experience, had we not pre-paid for the 3 nights we would have moved hotel the very next morning!||||Two big thumbs down for this experience and the owner's customer service alone.  Well, no customer service to speak of.||||||3) Too many mosquitoes, no mosquito net!||So with mosquitoes everywhere outside, and quite a few inside the room all the three of us got bitten everynight.  Our poor one year old baby, she got bitten every night, on her legs, arms and face.||||Definitely don't recommend staying here with kids.  You get eaten alive by mosquitoes in the room.||||||4) Housekeeping \u0026 room cleaning||Even though fresh towels and sheets are changed everyday, however there is a lot left to be desired in the housekeeping department when it comes to room cleaning service.||||The mop was used for the entire room without being washed because a water bucket was nowhere to be seen during the operation.  So afterwards, even though the entire floor was mopped it still felt dirty and our feet got dirty in minutes again.||||Air freshener was used but it actually was stinky and quite suffocating!||||||5) No room service for breakfast||Despite having pre-ordered our breakfasts, the next morning when I rang reception, the owner refused to have breakfast brought to our room.  We ended up feeding our baby in the room, then having breakfast in the courtyard later, which pretty much took the whole morning.  By the time we finished breakfast and managed to get out of the house, it was 11am!||Subsequent mornings, after even more repeat requests they reluctantly brought breakfasts to our room so we could eat and feed our child at the same time to save time.||||It should not be that difficult with room service, it's pretty normal, especially given we have a little baby with us.||||This BnB is not at all baby friendly.||||||6) Very limited English||No one at this BnB could speak English adequately so they can make themselves understood, nor could they understand my requests without me having to repeat them for the nth time.||- the young boys could understand some but not speak English at all||- the owner misunderstood my request for dinner, ordered too many dishes for 2 people||- the owner misunderstood my request for taxi to the airport, instead of waiting for me to call reception around 10am, a taxi was ordered in exact at 10am.  The taxi driver ended up waiting for nearly an hour before we were ready.||||||It's a family business, so obviously they tried their best but their service still need many improvements to make it worth while.||||||Overall, it was barely a satisfactory stay given the problems described above.  The fact the fumes from the mosquito fumigation got into our room while baby was sleeping and the owner did not let us know in advance was unacceptable.  Adequate English is a must to ensure sufficient communication.||||The best tips I can give you||Tip #1: if you are planning to stay on a Sunday night, check with them about mosquito fumigation||Tip #2: use an English/Burmese translator (such as Google Translate) to avoid misunderstandings||Tip #3: the BnB is always almost empty, so you probably don't need to book so many nights in advance.  Stay for a couple of nights first and see if it's worth the budget option.||||Recommendation?  Only if the owner improves on those points mentioned above, then yes.||||For me, I will be staying elsewhere next time around."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sharon B"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QeFH6dzZjd_ZFLhXHZKibEzXEy8hWzFB4Qa7PutLe3CnO2G7yVfjd4VSabiCQwQYo5W-g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""Very comfortable bed, serviceable room with everything we needed, brilliant breakfast, super helpful staff, easy access to downtown Yangon via taxi, close walk to Ocean Supermarket.
