Upon check-in, she demanded a document or authorization to travel, citing their hotel policy. Despite explaining my situation as an ASEAN citizen, allowed to stay for up to 14 days without such documentation, she remained insistent. Please note that I stayed at hotels in Yangon and Bagan during this trip and  no one asked me about additional documents during check in process. I only had to show my passport with the immigration stamp.\n\nAfter an unnecessary delay, she presented me with a blank document, insisting I sign it for submission to immigration. When I refused, she responded with condescension, pushing me to comply with an annoyed demeanor. What appalled me the most was her veiled threat, implying that I needed to behave \""if [I] don't do anything/something bad,\"" which I found utterly inappropriate and offensive. In the end, she gave up and said go ahead and fill up the form and sign. I explained I don't sign blank documents and will write my personal details before I sign.\n\nDespite my grievances, I must commend another staff member, Ngying Yatu Aung, for his professionalism and genuine concern for my well-being. However, the demeaning treatment I received from the receptionist overshadowed any positive aspects of my stay. I write this review as a cautionary tale to others and advise them to seek accommodations elsewhere.

An excellent choice in Mandalay.||||I have stayed 4 times over the last 4 years, each time staying between 4 and 7 nights. When travelling with my wife we pay that little extra for a Queen Suite. They are spacious, well furnished and a great choice.  In February, when I was by myself on business (starting a little importing), I took a Superior room for 7 nights which was perfect with a good desk to do some work and their Wi-Fi is also quite good. ||||I should remark on some of the previous reviews. The complaint about the loud disco was for Valentine’s Day!  The Sky View bar is normally quite sedate and perfect for a nightcap. I have never had a problem with the hot water. The “Horror Visit” review is definitely not this hotel. The reception is on the ground floor on a main road, not an alley, and with a doorman always in attendance. ||||I really like the location. There is a good beer station on the corner of 32nd street, the “Golden Spider”, they do a great dried goat salad, ‘set dah chow’,  which is a perfect accompaniment to a few beers. A couple of blocks down you have “Aye Myit Tar”  a superb traditional Burmese curry restaurant and another block further “Super 81” with Chinese BBQ on the ground floor, an air-con  room on the 1st floor and open air rooftop further up, all offering their excellent a la carte Chinese food. And this is all for a bit of variation on the great food at the Queen’s own restaurant. ||||I would have no hesitation recommending the Queen to any one visiting Mandalay, in fact my wife and her sister are be checking in tomorrow for 4 nights."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ben R"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QfHhPp0vyvo1Wo3WY4NH1G5QOPAHGBMv_XiebXLZtHzVwVa3wkRhb3dykyKrUCZPlawDA=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""I was very happy to stay at the hotel.

The workers at the front desk are always very polite and helpful, and the guy in charge of housekeeping and room service, Kyaw Zin Tun, always goes out of his way to make sure that my requests are handled. Kudos also to the restaurant on the top floor. They offer a very good buffet breakfast. I'm not one of those Westerners that like a Western breakfast (hey, I'm in Myanmar, I want to eat the local food!) so appreciate the range of noodles and rice dishes, especially their excellent monhinga. Very tasty! I've also dined there for lunch and breakfast and the entrée dishes are also of very high quality. They also have a very good band that plays there in the evening. ||||What more can I say about this fine hotel? They offer free bicycle rentals to guests, have wi-fi in the rooms (or a computer downstairs that you can use), have a travel agent with money exchange service in the lobby, and offer the sort of friendly personal service that is so common in Myanmar.

It is by far the best among the 3 same star hotels I stayed in myanmar trip. The bed is so comfortable.

An English news channel would have been nice. ||||The hotel breakfast buffet is really basic and there’s always a queue at the egg station, but it sufficient to kickstart the day. There are some food kiosks across the streets. However, I am not keen to tackle the chilly weather and tricky traffic early in the morning so I stick to the restaurant for my entire stay. As an added bonus, you can watch the sunrise from the hotel restaurant as it features an unblocked view of Mandalay city. Pity the restaurant is closed after breakfast.

However, the wifi in our room (on the second level) did not work at all and the room smelt a bit funny (like sewerage, but I guess that might just be a thing in Myanmar plumbing). The staff offered to let us change to a different room where the wifi would be working (as they couldn't get it working) but we had already unpacked and was only staying one night so we kindly declined their offer. Other than that, the room was fine and the breakfast was also decent (mostly Myanmar style breakfast). Location of the hotel is also great if you're arriving by train. Restaurants are at a walkable distance or a short tuk tuk ride away.||||The hotel organised a driver for us to visit selected sights in Mandalay and to drive us to Bagan the following day. We paid quite a bit for the service ($160 USD) and they said it was going to be an English speaking driver. However, there was something dodgy going on with the driver (not the hotel's fault). The English speaking driver that was booked picked us up from the hotel, then drove for 2 minutes and told us that he's sick and his brother will be driving us for the day. His brother was very nice, but barely spoke a word of English so we were really confused when he dropped us off at the attractions (he didn't give us any information at all). We had no idea whether we needed to buy tickets and if so, where to buy the tickets. He had to phone his brother several times, basically every time we asked a question or if he wanted to ask us a question. I'm not sure why his brother didn't just pick us up from the hotel in the first place (perhaps he was trying to do a sneaky and didn't want the hotel to know that he offloaded a job to someone else?). We set off to Bagan at around 4pm, so I think the driver was in a bit of a rush to drop us off so he can return to Mandalay at a reasonable time. He drove extremely fast (the car didn't have any seatbeats so we were a bit concerned) and even hit a dog and killed it :( (he apologised for hitting the dog when we arrived at Bagan)"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Max G"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0Qf66pF81jsVXBxevYxxL5FsdlDsKAngAUpJVE-hAwai1rl8J0QnYqktKV3UGdpbmNlc_A=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""We stayed there for two nights in two different rooms because we made a mistake when booking.

Drainage system in washroom and washing basin were very slow due to blocked with hair. That’s why hotel management and housekeeping staff need attention and take care with drain cleaning powder. Other main problem there was slow WiFi. It’s immediately requirement tusk for all local and foreigners guests. Breakfast there was better than other 4 stars hotels from Mandalay.

Curiously, half the reviews said it was quiet and half found the train horn noise too much.  It is situated on top of the main rail terminal.  My view is in between these extremes.  We were here three nights.  I am a very light sleeper.  My girlfriend could sleep through WWIII.  The first night, I heard the train horn blow 7 times.  Not a good sleep at all.  The next two nights, I slept 7.5 and 8 hours and didn't wake up once!  I did not use ear plugs, although I had them.  She slept soundly every night.||||||That's the only bad news.  I must admit, that when I entered my room the first time, I was sad to see such cheap furniture.  Also, there was a staleness to the air, but it was not really noticeable the remaining three days.  We had a large room.  The shower is basically just a curtain pulled over a section of the bathroom.  There is a small bar on the floor, but it only works 75% at keeping the water in the shower area.  We just put down a towel on the floor and that solved the problem.  The highlight of the bathroom is that this is one of the best shampoos I ever used.  In my 200+ trips overseas, only once before did I have \""squeaky clean\"" hair! Air conditioning and internet were excellent.||||||The breakfast was very good.  My girfriend is Asian and she lover that food.  I ate Western and it was satisfying.  Usually the bacon was well done which I like.  Once it was almost raw and they happily re-cooked it until I was satisfied.  The bread pudding is very dry, but 5 feet away was a gravy boat with sweetened condensed milk.  I poured it on the putting and let it sit.  Then, the pudding was great!  There is a very nice variety and they change about 35% of it daily  The capucino was excellent!  The black tea (Lipton) must have been a very high grade - not the normal terrible kind because it, too, was excellent.||||We ate dinner here one night because ROASTED PEKING DUCK for 3-5 people was only US $10.00!!!!  I later found out that roasted is not the same as traditional Peking Duck.  There were no pancakes, but they made crepes for us!  Also, quite cute, there was no hoisin sauce - rather we had American barbeque sauce!  What a hoot!

Usual Passport scan \u0026 they were handed back. Escorted up to our room \u0026 the facilities were adequate.

Room is quite large in comparison to usual size \u0026 the bathroom is bigger too. There is a in room safe, TV, WiFi is good, Bed is standard Asia offering (firm to hard), floor not to slippery in Bathroom after shower. || Elevator was a little bit on the slow side sometimes but for a large hotel like this it has only one so just be patient. Breakfast is a standard type with both Asian \u0026 Western choices available. I spotted the coffee machine on the first morning of breakfast \u0026 asked if I could pay for a coffee \u0026 it was not problem to the staff. it was all good until they ran out of beans on the last morning. oh well, two out of three aint bad. We had two dinner meals there over our stay \u0026 they where fabulous. They even let us have a table out on the balcony of the restaurant \u0026 while we dined the sun went down over Mandalay City. They are building a roof top bar set up on the roof of the hotel \u0026 when that is operational. It will be a great place to sit up there \u0026 have a few drinks. The roof top has stunning views of the city \u0026 surroundings. We had a free day on our last day there \u0026 hailing a tuk tuk to the main market was easy. In the the afternoon I used the Spa facilities \u0026 had an Awesome Thai body massage \u0026 foot massage. All the staff were very helpful \u0026 any requests where met with \""can do\"" attitude.

The first impression was a bit of a shock as we were in very good hotels in both Yangon and Inle, but we appreciated the hotel and it's location much more as our stay progressed.  We chose a more upgraded room which had a comfortable seating area and coffee table.  We had booked through the hotel and found that very efficient.||||As we got to know Mandalay better, we realised a lot of hotels are in very noisy positions as it is a big, bustling city, so quite rightly we had been advised to choose this one when I had asked on the forums for a quiet hotel.  The service and food was also good, so no complaints - it was more Mandalay which we were not too keen on.  We were able to walk to a local street market which was very interesting as it was not a tourist market (staff can advise how to get there - they are very helpful).  We also used a car/driver suggested by them for excursions on three days.  His name was Mr Bob and he had a big modern minibus, so it was quite a bit of luxury for just two of us and his prices were good as well.  He took us to a couple of restaurants, one was very good, the other not so much.||||Overall we enjoyed our time in Mandalay as there is quite a lot to do from there, but we would have liked a better pool area as it was very small and shaded with a lot of overhanging trees.  The trees could have been cut back to improve the area considerably.  We ate in the hotel most evenings and found the food good and well priced.||||We also found a very good laundry not far from there (but not very near either).  It was called Laundry King.  I had a skirt washed in the hotel once and it shrank a bit, so would not suggest using the hotel laundry service."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""AnneF56"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QfjHmZg8gr7jpDgKhrh5KsR_Mq7L6pkVedvpKQz-f3LMiOd3OjI90CK4uLtF3wE59zZgA=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""We stayed one night at Mandalay City Hotel and found it very clean and comfortable.

The hotel is aptly named because it is tucked away near \""Ye Sit Kan\"" (filtering pond) close to a residential area, yet easy access to downtown and major attractions in Mandalay via tuk tuk or taxi.  The staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were nice, breakfasts were good with attentive staff, the rooftop pool and restaurant were also nice with great service and amazing views of the city, sunsets and Mandalay Hill in the distance to the north.||||The best part was the outstanding service from the friendly staff who helped us arrange a car to drive us down to Bagan.  When we got to Bagan, I realized that I lost my lens cap somewhere but didn't know where.  The next day, the hotel staff in Bagan informed me that Hotel the Haven called saying that they found my lens cap and that they would have it delivered to the hotel in Bagan from Madalay.  Now, that is service!  I think the name of the employee is \""Ma Hnin?\"" who handled this, so thank you very much Ma Hnin!  To the hotel management - please consider this my commendation of Ma Hnin for her excellent customer service.  In the grand scheme of things, the value of a lens cap is insignificant, but the lengths that Ma Hnin went to demonstrates how much she cares about her hotel guests and it goes a long long way beyond the cost of the lens cap or the delivery cost.  Many thanks again, we will definitely stay here again.||||My only suggestion for this hotel - please consider expanding traditional Burmese dishes on your restaurant menu and breakfasts.

After a lot of travelling to get there, we just wanted somewhere to relax.  We found the Ayarwaddy River View Hotel was terrific - they were so welcoming and friendly, it was the perfect place to stay.||||We stayed in a suite, which was a really big room and had plenty of space for us and our two children - there were two big rooms, plus a bathroom and a good sized room for putting our bags in.  The room was airconditioned, had two bar fridges, a safe and TV.  The bathroom was a good size and clean.||||The view from the roof bar/restaurant was excellent - watching the boats chug up and down the river and just to relax.  Food was a bit slow at times, but we were never really in a hurry.  The roof bar got busy around sunset, so make sure you're ahead of time if you want to get a spot looking over the river.||||The breakfasts were delicious, which always made a good start to the day.||||The best thing about this hotel was the service.  They went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and it was never any trouble for them to help make arrangements for taxis, day trips etc.  The service here was the best at any hotel we stayed at in Myanmar - it really makes a difference.||||The hotel isn't located close to a lot of sights, but that's the trade off for the river view.  Taxis aren't expensive, so we never had trouble getting around.  It is nice and handy to the tourist jetty if you're doing a day trip to Mingun, which we did.||||The other terrific thing about this hotel was the refillable water bottles.  Each guest had a glass waterbottle, which you could refill at various spots around the hotel.  Such an excellent idea, because so many small waterbottles end up in the rubbish in Myanmar.   More hotels should pick up on this!||||The hotel also has a pool and there is an ATM right out the front of it, which was super handy.||||All up, it was a great hotel to start off our trip to Myanmar.  I'd definitely recommend it to others.

View of Eindawya Pagoda and Sagaing Hills from the breakfast room on the roof top were good. The Room was reasonably clean.    ||||Negative: Staff receive little or no training or support from management \u0026 are too few in number during the high season to do their job properly, eg room servicing, proper cleaning \u0026 maintenaince. If a problem arises, management is likely to disappear \u0026 leave the Receptionists to flounder around with an inadequate command of English whilst the Guest becomes evermore frustrated. Consequently there is a high turnover of dissatisfied staff. Additionally communication \u0026 record keeping between Reception staff is often poor, resulting in Guests thinking an arrangement has been agreed, only to find that a later Receptionist on duty either has a different record to the one agreed, or no record at all. This particularly applies to travel arrangements made from the Hotel, Laundry handed in at the front desk, previously agreed Bills for staying at the Hotel \u0026 arranging to stay a few extra hours after check-out-time, all of which should be routine stuff.||Regarding Food Hygiene: Breakfast cutlery and plates are left exposed for 24 hours to dry on a table in the open air on the roof top while lots of pigeons wander around the tables \u0026 surfaces defecating.  The washing-up is obviously done in one go without changing the water, as the cutlery always had a greasy film covering it. The toilet on the breakfast roof top area is opposite the kitchen and kitchen staff using it have been observed not washing their hands in the sink provided nearby. ||||On various occasions we offered to give Management suggestions as to how they could improve their service, but these were cheerfully rebuffed, presumably on the basis that most of their guests never stayed more than a day or two, so the guest/problem would soon disappear forgetting that we are now in the age of online reviews."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Saw M"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QeFH6dzZjd_ZFLhXHZKibEzXEy8hWzFB4Qa7PutLe3CnO2G7yVfjd4VSabiCQwQYo5W-g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""This is my second time to mandalay and very nice choose.

I saw the monkey only out of her small cage once and that was when I encouraged the staff to let her out.  It made me feel quite sad.

I was looking forward to a little swim in their beautiful pool and to a quiet, comfortable stay whilst we explored Mandalay. (We are a well travelled couple in our early 40s taking a year long break from our working lives and backpacking for 3 months so far, and were looking forward to a little bit of luxury for a few days.)||||Unfortunately we arrived at a hotel that seemed to be mid refurbishment - we even wondered, as we walked in, whether they were open for business. (They insisted they were.) The \""garden\"" had been cleared out and was bare (no plants or animals as described, just concrete and a layer of dirt with minimal garden furniture). The pool had dirty water up to an adult's knee with children's toys floating inside. There was personal laundry and more toys thrown across the lobby, with dust and dirt on the floor as we entered the hotel. The ashtray was full of cigarette buds and water and didn't seem to be cleaned for a while. It is currently low season, so perhaps they just didn't expect anyone. Nobody seemed to care about the state the hotel was in. ||||We had booked for 4 nights and really hoped our stay would improve, but sadly it didn't. Unfortunately it really was one disappointment after another. To their credit, the room was clean, lovely and comfortable, but I would hardly call the hotel's services even a 1 star, and the continued disappointment just made the overall stay a frustrating and underwhelming experience. ||||- Location: It really is quite far from everything in Mandalay (at least 2kms to the NW corner of the palace moat), so make sure their bikes are working or plan to rent a motorbike / install Grab on your phone.||||- Cleanliness: They never seemed to clean the hotel (reception, garden, pool area, etc) for the duration of our stay. The kids toys stayed where they were, unless the kids moved it. There were 2 dogs roaming around throughout - assume they were being looked after by the manager or staff. They were cute but seemed to have fleas...! (I like dogs, but inside the hotel building?)||||- Bikes: All rental bikes had flat tyres the first night. They hadn't been serviced at all. The hotel staff couldn't fix it for us for our first night due to lack of tools. To their credit, 2 were fixed up  the following morning and were in rideable condition, albeit old and clunky. Call them beforehand if you expect to use them!||||- Pool: The boy behind reception said they were cleaning the pool and that it would be ready the following day. No cleaning seemed to be done for the duration of our stay whilst the manager/staff's kids played in the dirty water and made a lot of noise. Their toys remained in the pool. It was non operational for guests. FYI the swimming pool is in the hotel lobby as you walk in and is more like an oversized bathtub, so don't expect to have a swim if you're an adult and check beforehand that it's working if you're expecting a dip.||||-Staff: They didn't seem to have a lot of staff on duty and they didn't speak very good English. They were nice but everyone in Myanmar that we've met so far has been absolutely lovely. So nothing exceptional from the hotel staff and we were disappointed by their lack of care overall.||||- Garden: Not even worth mentioning at the moment. It was just some garden furniture on dirt. Not sure if they're re-doing it, I would hope so for their sake!||||- Room: We stayed in the delux double and the room is 3 star, to their credit. Good amenities, working air-conditioning, Internet, clean towels, a comfortable bed with clean sheets. They have a bathtub with a power shower (European style!) with hot water. Unfortunately though, their safety box was broken, the satellite TV did not work and the fridge broke down on our 3rd night. We also had to ask them to refill the coffee and water on arrival as they were not re-stocked since their previous guests. ||||- Breakfast: Assume this was massively scaled down as we seemed to be the only guests staying in the rooms. We were given some toast, 3 slices of cheese to share between us two, jam (which was actually quite tasty), a choice of omelette or fried eggs, fruit (an apple, sliced) and coffee everyday. I had seen photos of their continental breakfast buffet, so was thoroughly disappointed. We were given a make shift table next to the dirty pool and toys.||||- Serenity: Perhaps this was due to the lack of other guests and us staying during the summer holidays, but the manager/staff's kids were shouting and playing until the late hours (midnight) in the lobby and the garden. I had to make a complaint as we couldn't sleep one night.||||I really wish I could have written a positive review but unfortunately this was not the case. The hotel was nothing like the photos or description, except for the clean room, but even that had issues. ||||Overall, Mega Stars has potential and could be a lovely place to stay, and perhaps during high season it raises the bar. They were probably expecting a group on the day we left, as suddenly, overnight, the pool had been cleaned and filled and they had swept and cleaned. It felt like a slap in the face for us. ||||Beware if you're coming during low season, as it seemed to turn into their \""home\"" and definitely not ready to accept hotel guests. I felt like we were in the way and couldn't have been happier to leave. I would hardly call this place a 3 star based on our stay and consider it unrecommendable."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jon B"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0Qdx0CtChWdL4amzhVtedU6JgNzs3A9KzPS8K998c7-u-mDeTb-7WQwuTD-PPX6BcVA5wg=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""As ever the hotel staff were courteous, accommodating \u0026 helpful.|A pity the hotel DOES NOT deliver to the information/description given on either Agoda/Booking - there was no hotel bar/restaurant at all.

They provide welcome drinks not just on their guests' first arrival but on every return to the hotel at the end of each day.||||The owner Htun is always personally available to guests to make them feel at home, and encourages a spirit of generosity in his staff. Htun is personally excellent with kids: our two, a boy of 7 and girl of 10, absolutely loved him. He is also part of a small team of players of the national ball game Chinlone / Caneball who not only play a nightly game in the hotel garden - which is absolutely riveting to watch - but also invite guests and their children to have a go, and it's not easy to play!! ||||The hotel restaurant food is beautiful: a nice mix of Asian veg and meat dishes, noodles and some sensational \""finger fish\"" and fries: battered fish fingers and English-style chips, which were great for our fussy western children! The breakfast is good: cereals, lovely brown bread (to counter the prevalence everywhere in Asia of slightly sickly sweet white bread), eggs and some Asian breakfast options such as rice, veg and noodles. Most amazing of all about the restaurant is the view of misty Mandalay Hill which is to die for. The swimming pool is pleasant although we didn't use it much as the evening temperatures in December when we stayed were relatively low and the water was a little cold: it would be great in the hot season months from April to October.||||Probably the jewel in the experience of staying at Hotel Mega Stars is the presence of \""Jewel\"", the resident monkey, who is a sweetheart. At first we came with our Western preconceptions of \""is this animal safe?\"" and \""is it right for there to be a wild animal kept in a cage in the garden?\"" In fact, Jewel is a rescue monkey whose mother was killed by hunters - she is free to roam, and as and when she wants to, she enters and leaves her large garden habitat which is surrounded by netting and shared with some very gentle and friendly rabbits. Yes, monkeys and rabbits get on like a house on fire, we discovered! Jewel swings around the trees of the garden and amazingly, she recognises instinctively those guests who are into hugging monkeys and those who aren't. We read another review that stated that the rabbits have made the place extremely dirty - this is totally inaccurate. In fact, the whole hotel is extremely clean - on one morning when we were in a mad hurry to leave, we left our room in an absolute state ...not only had the staff come in to make the beds and change the towels but they had also carefully folded all our clothes for us!||||Our children loved Jewel - she is very domesticated, and runs up to those who put their arms out to her, acting like a big baby, snuggling in close for a hug. Probably for the presence of Jewel alone, but also because of Htun's warmth and kindness as an owner, our children will never let us visit Mandalay again without staying at Hotel Mega Stars. ||||In the interests of offering a balanced picture, I'd say the only small negatives - all of which were far outweighed by the positives - were the slightly limited WIFI which at present (December 2016) is available in the lobby only but Htun the owner is fighting hard to have a proper hotel wide broadband installed in early 2017, and will I'm sure succeed in this goal; the distance from town is longer than some other hotels at 15-20 minutes by car, but actually, taxis are cheap and easy to come by (5000 kyats or US$5.00 from town) and I must say after the very busy days we spent in Mandalay, it was a very welcome break from the noise and bustle of the city to get a little way outside at night; the only other thing was that the temperature of the water in the shower was quite hard to regulate - it took some time, a few minutes, for the hot water to arrive, and then if anything it had a tendancy to be too hot and hard to turn down. Perhaps some thermostat-type taps would help with this. None of these things are reasons not to come to Mega Stars: not at all.||||We spent our time in Mandalay working in a school for disadvantaged children and Htun offered a gift to the school at the end of our stay of plants from his beautifully cultivated garden.||||Overall, the hotel is a very happy place where guests' suggestions are taken very seriously as Htun is keen for his establishment to be the best hotel in Mandalay.

There was a minibar and two free bottles of water per day.  Some rooms have laminate floors, some have carpet, which tends to get dirty quickly given the dusty/muddy condition of the streets of Mandalay.  The AC worked very well and the hotel has a back-up generator.  There is an elevator, but as others have noted, you still need to climb some steps (maybe 10?) to get to it from the lobby. ||The internet was generally ok, though a few times it seemed to get very slow, but if you waited 5 minutes or got out and then back in it was fine again.  They have a computer you can use in the lobby and if you need something printed like I did, they had me email the document at printed it up for me at the front desk for no charge.||The bathrooms were a good size, clean and fairly modern, with an electrical outlet which makes it convenient to use an electric razor or a hair dryer - this was missing in many of the other hotels we stayed at in Myanmar.  Another feature they had that is often lacking in Myanmar hotels is a shower curtain, so we were happy about that too!||One reason I chose this hotel was because I wanted something fairly central, and I was pretty happy with my choice.  It’s within a few minutes walk of a few decent restaurants and some of the interesting sights of Mandalay, but the city is spread out so no matter where you stay you will probably end up taking a taxi and/or hiring a driver and car for the day.  ||On that note the hotel provided  very competitive rates and a very good driver for us to go to Sagaing/Inwa/Amarapura one day and to Pyin oo Lwin another day.  His car was comfortable, clean and he wasn’t afraid to use the AC, though unfortunately, like most vehicles we were in in Mandalay, there were no seatbelts in the backseat.  Fortunately he was a very safe driver and we had no mishaps caused by other less cautious drivers!||Breakfast at the hotel was ok, they cooked eggs to order, offered bacon on alternating days, had some type of fruit every day and bread/toast.  They also had Asian breakfast food.  The one thing that was missing was yogurt.  They offer breakfast packs if you have to catch an early boat to Bagan or an early bus/train.||We used their laundry service, they charge by the item, not by weight, but the prices were not exorbitant, roughly 400-600 kyat per item, and they did a good job of it.  ||The two young women at the front desk with whom we interacted the most were very helpful and spoke quite good English.  For our second stay we arrived very early in the morning by bus from Inle lake and the gentleman working the front desk overnight gave us a room right away, which was very much appreciated.||For the price we paid we thought it was good value, comfort and service.

I supposed a normal roof top with some stools and tables like in the pics, but seriously that was totally sad and depressing. Went up stairs, lights off, then a guy lay in the bar.

The wifi was above average but can sometimes cut off as did the power but i doubt this intermittent wifi/electricity was the fault of the hotel.\nThere is also a modern gym and an adult pool, not huge but sufficient for laps but due to it not being indoor, the water was super cold. 🥶\nBest part of my two night stay was the nice breakfast buffet with western and local dishes. Nice local noodles, tea, latte, pastry and eggs made to order. Their choice of western dishes was also good such as their steak dinner.\nDue to our event in their ballroom, we enjoyed corporate rates which was decent.
