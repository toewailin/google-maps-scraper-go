I had an extra night in yangon on my way to bangkok and booked here again, but got a different room. Same, lovely bed but the room was smaller so thats why i recomend the other room.

This felt like a blatant attempt to squeeze more money out of guests, and I found it completely unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, when I tried to discuss this issue with the staff, they were unhelpful and dismissive, showing a lack of empathy towards my situation.

Staff was friendly as the hotel is family owned. Since we left very early the next morning (around 4am) we were not able to experience the breakfast but complimentary water in the room was nice. Rooms are a bit small but clean and with A/C and TV. Elevator functions well. The rooms are otherwise basic.

They make you feel at home, always with a smile and ready to help. The staff is outstanding.\n\nThe Location: The cleanliness is exquisite, the rooms are bright, new, and have a modern style with great design. The beds are super comfortable, and when you close the curtains, it’s completely dark, allowing for ideal rest. The rooms are spacious and tidy, with a practical and clean bathroom, and a large wardrobe for storing clothes. The security is excellent, and the atmosphere is pleasant and tranquil, featuring pools on the terrace.\n\nFood: The dining is excellent and very reasonably priced.\n\nI’m genuinely surprised because I’ve tried to find a flaw but haven’t been able to.\n\nBefore this hotel, I stayed at a typical resort where the crowds, noise, and activities overwhelm any sense of tranquility. Upon arriving here, I quickly felt at home, relaxed, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be in a hotel that combines the warmth of a cozy establishment with the comfort and decor of a high-end hotel.\n\nI highly recommend it. I can’t express enough gratitude to the staff and the manager, who treats guests with enthusiasm and warmth, paying close attention to every detail.\n\nIn short: warmth, comfort, cleanliness, incredible infrastructure, magnificent service, and a tranquil environment—100% recommendable.

Perhaps the result of  past smoking in the room?  Decor wise the whole place is dated and makes me feel like I've stepped into a 90's film actually some parts resembled the Titanic! I kinda liked that but whatever floats your boat I guess! I can deal with it for a night. I was super happy with the gym, which was clean and well equipt. The pool area is nice but looks a bit like an oasis in a desert. There is huge space around the pool that is used for functions. My purpose for booking this hotel was for the use of the gym and pool before a late night flight the day after. I wanted to spend my last day chilling by the pool but there was indeed a poolside funtion, which meant the pool was closed. I explained my purpose for booking to the manager and he was understanding and allowed me to swim while the staff were preping the event. I am very pleased with his understanding of this situation. Though still slightly frustrated that I could'nt spend my last day by the pool.

And all of the sudden it was hard to breath and I could not see much of the sitting area because the whole room was filled with smoke!  I quickly grabbed the sleeping baby, ran out of the room upstairs to the reception area to ask what was wrong!  With very limited English the owner later managed to tell me that it was the regular Sunday night mosquito fumigation and somehow the fumes got into our room.||||He knew about it and yet did nothing to warn us, knowing full well that we checked in with a small baby.||||Not acceptable.||||||2) Room change||Understandably I was very worried about the toxicity of the fumes and our baby, requested that we change room to another one that's the same size and setup.  There was only one tripple room, all other rooms were smaller which meant a downgrade, but the owner refused to give a discount even if we downgrade to a smaller room to avoid the smoke.||We ended up having to wait until the smoke cleared, coming back to and sleeping in the same room that night.||||Such welcoming event on our first night.  It was an extremely stressful experience, had we not pre-paid for the 3 nights we would have moved hotel the very next morning!||||Two big thumbs down for this experience and the owner's customer service alone.  Well, no customer service to speak of.||||||3) Too many mosquitoes, no mosquito net!||So with mosquitoes everywhere outside, and quite a few inside the room all the three of us got bitten everynight.  Our poor one year old baby, she got bitten every night, on her legs, arms and face.||||Definitely don't recommend staying here with kids.  You get eaten alive by mosquitoes in the room.||||||4) Housekeeping \u0026 room cleaning||Even though fresh towels and sheets are changed everyday, however there is a lot left to be desired in the housekeeping department when it comes to room cleaning service.||||The mop was used for the entire room without being washed because a water bucket was nowhere to be seen during the operation.  So afterwards, even though the entire floor was mopped it still felt dirty and our feet got dirty in minutes again.||||Air freshener was used but it actually was stinky and quite suffocating!||||||5) No room service for breakfast||Despite having pre-ordered our breakfasts, the next morning when I rang reception, the owner refused to have breakfast brought to our room.  We ended up feeding our baby in the room, then having breakfast in the courtyard later, which pretty much took the whole morning.  By the time we finished breakfast and managed to get out of the house, it was 11am!||Subsequent mornings, after even more repeat requests they reluctantly brought breakfasts to our room so we could eat and feed our child at the same time to save time.||||It should not be that difficult with room service, it's pretty normal, especially given we have a little baby with us.||||This BnB is not at all baby friendly.||||||6) Very limited English||No one at this BnB could speak English adequately so they can make themselves understood, nor could they understand my requests without me having to repeat them for the nth time.||- the young boys could understand some but not speak English at all||- the owner misunderstood my request for dinner, ordered too many dishes for 2 people||- the owner misunderstood my request for taxi to the airport, instead of waiting for me to call reception around 10am, a taxi was ordered in exact at 10am.  The taxi driver ended up waiting for nearly an hour before we were ready.||||||It's a family business, so obviously they tried their best but their service still need many improvements to make it worth while.||||||Overall, it was barely a satisfactory stay given the problems described above.  The fact the fumes from the mosquito fumigation got into our room while baby was sleeping and the owner did not let us know in advance was unacceptable.  Adequate English is a must to ensure sufficient communication.||||The best tips I can give you||Tip #1: if you are planning to stay on a Sunday night, check with them about mosquito fumigation||Tip #2: use an English/Burmese translator (such as Google Translate) to avoid misunderstandings||Tip #3: the BnB is always almost empty, so you probably don't need to book so many nights in advance.  Stay for a couple of nights first and see if it's worth the budget option.||||Recommendation?  Only if the owner improves on those points mentioned above, then yes.||||For me, I will be staying elsewhere next time around."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sharon B"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QeFH6dzZjd_ZFLhXHZKibEzXEy8hWzFB4Qa7PutLe3CnO2G7yVfjd4VSabiCQwQYo5W-g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""Very comfortable bed, serviceable room with everything we needed, brilliant breakfast, super helpful staff, easy access to downtown Yangon via taxi, close walk to Ocean Supermarket.

The location is a little out of main town centre but I liked it, although you do feel it during the day when the sun is glaring. Sidewalks are poor to non existent so if you have a walking child you need to be extra careful. If you have a buggy it's going to be a bit of a pain but doable. Night time is much better temp wise but it does feel a little dark and dingy walking back/to the hotel in sections of road near the hotel.

( my so called luxury condo’s elevator is very bad compared to this hotel) Especially, I would like to thank the housekeeper staff nyi ma lay. She is very professional and helpful to me. At that time, I am very anxious and stressed due to exam. She just cleaned the room, without bothering me and making a noise. And of course, the receptionist.

The owner / management can use the yellow pages listing kept in the room to find out a vendor from the era of 2020, who would know to fit tiles and does the grooving neatly. Also this change can only be brought about by the owners if they believe and have faith in the fact that a neat washroom is an integral part of hotel accommodation.

We checked-in around 3PM. Says you can check-in starting at 2PM. But when we arrived, the room wasn't quite ready yet. They were still fixing the water heater. They informed us that we'll be able to use hot water by night-time. The Side Table and Stools weren't even arranged properly when we arrived. We specifically requested the lake view room but was allocated at the 5th floor where the lake can't be seen as it's covered by trees. Still we get the view of Shwedagon Pagoda though. The room was hot, humid and a bit dusty when we checked in. Bed sheets are stained in some places but we didn't complain. What I was disgusted most by is the mold in Shower Curtains. Yuck! And hair remains in the bathtub and floor near the bed. At night, I turned on hot water and all I got was air, rusted brown water and cold water. I called them to check and they came in claiming the water is usable and is warm. It wasn't. Don't let me start with the room key card... Works 1 out of 30 tries. They came to change batteries both in the evening and the next morning. Every time we get out of the room we get locked out even though we have the key card with us. The only good thing was the tasty breakfast with a wide variety to choose from. Even for breakfast, the dining room arrangement sucked. They put two extra tables and chairs close to the buffet table and we have to tuck through these to get the food. Ugh... And they rang the doorbell at 7 AM mistakenly with the next room who were to check-out that morning. Didn't even say they were sorry for the interruption. We were given breakfast tickets but when we arrived at the dining room, no one was there to collect it so we left these tickets on the table after we were done eating. Guess what? They called us at 9AM and said it was the last call for breakfast. Good that they remind us for Breakfast, bad that they suck at who has finished eating and who have not. Overall, it seems overrated and overpriced compared to other hotels in town. Maybe they treat us locals differently from foreigners, not sure about that, as the room rates for locals and foreigners are different. But I think, for the same price, there are many hotels out there that give better service and facilities than those provided here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTjv-D6zKesrZz3a9TCruPYLhsrV5_JvBM9upK\u0026fid=0x0:0xf4763ad7a8ba89c5""],""When"":""2023-6-3""}]",

The rooms are clean and maintained well. They even have an ATM in the lobby. There is a 24hour CityMart (local supermarket) nearby. Since the hotel is on the main road, you can easily get Grab (like Uber car sharing service) and go around the city.\n\nDo read my previous review below:\n\n*****************************\nOld review from 2017 below:\n\nWe stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in the Superior twin room and 2 nights in the Junior Suite B with Bathtub. As most of the reviews have already mentioned,  choose the rooms towards the back of the hotel (away from the road) and preferably to the right (facing east), these rooms have a better view and also you will get a glimpse of the rising sun. The hotel's buffet breakfast is great and each day they have a special local cuisine. This, in my opinion, would be a very safe way to try out the local dishes. The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained. The only problem is  that the doors do not appear to be sound proof and could be a problem if there are a lot of guests moving in-and-out of their rooms. TIP: There is a City Mart outlet straight down the road, about 15mins walk. There is a hospital nearby. There are some great food places in about 15mins walk.
