As a result When the room is available, the front desk attendant also charges an additional 20,000 kyat service fee, which is inconsistent with the price I agreed with the front desk waiter on the phone before, but I was so tired that I didn't change the hotel. The front desk staff didn't help me with my luggage. They only gave me the room key and let me go up by myself, so I don't understand what she charged the service fee. Righteousness! Going for a massage is also different from the price on the menu. There will be an additional charge, so I can only say that you must avoid the pitfalls"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOyWgholiPL8dPXGlwCoCJi4lIVD8D6iMwysvIU\u0026fid=0x0:0x1baa65eaa3c2b6c9""],""When"":""2025-1-30""},{""Name"":""Nay Linn Aung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXqFK9xhJw1M-L_bla9AbqBDyMkH5yTwnw1EmzQdOkkrblMFhM7wA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I stayed on the 11th floor in December 2024.

I have to greet good morning first.\n\nRoom/ 3 Stars - made a reservation with a confirmation of Premier room with king bed size in advance but they gave me twin joint bed, normally I won’t have any problem either King or twins Zipped bed however under the twin zipped bed, they placed normal sponge sheets which very hot and uncomfortable to sleep on. When I complained they said it was their standard.\n\nRoom Cleanliness/ 2 stars - a lot of previous guests hair (all type of hair) in under the floor and a lot of dust on the table. Extra pillow also very dirty, there was still on spot of stained on pillow, Look like a stained of human sperm.\n\nWhen I called Front office staff and show him how bad the room was arranged, they finally switch with another but have to wait 3 more hours to be able to move to new room. Now room was not very different about cleaning, i was also stepped on a piece of glass which the housekeeper didn’t do their job well. Also still have hair on the floor for a newly clean room.\n\nBreakfast/ 3 Stars - normal, not much choice.\n\nBellman - leaked of concentration. I was waiting for grab and when the grab arrived with another passengers, he opened the door for those passengers and when I was able to go in, he just closed the door. I was shocked for a second.\n\nHotel Location is Great which surrounding with restaurants.\n\nSuggest: please train the housekeepers well, ohh need to train the supervisor first.

The beds are extremely comfortable with duvets and white linen and fresh towels are provided daily. The bathroom has a walk-in shower and there is always plenty of hot water. Staff are delightful and extremely helpful and the manager Zayar is always eager to oblige. We asked for coffees in our room one day and he immediately sent up a kettle with sachets of coffee, creamer and sugar - all complimentary.

The hotel is only a few minutes drive from the airport and pickups can be arranged for just 5000 kyats (about $4) which saves you haggling with local taxi drivers. ||I had been staying at another nearby hotel which I have used for years but standards were declining so moved to Hotel 9 Mile on the recommendation of a local friend.

There is a massage parlor on site. Tried it but didn't like. They tend to grind your muscle against your bone. I thought that was not very good for the body. Otherwise price is reasonable. It is very difficult to communicate with the girls at the counter. They do not understand much English. I kept asking them to stop opening the window when they clean the room in the morning because of the mosquito but they do not seem to understand what I said. The manager speaks excellent English and is very helpful. Taxi fare to down town or anywhere for that matter is always 5000.

Small mini fridge as per normal and small safe box,which was not functioning unfortunately were provided. There was small little tv with 3 channels ridiculously. Breakfast were served with two varieties, American breakfast and Korean breakfast. I tried American and it was simple dish and nothing special. I noticed i was the only non-korean in the dinning room and whole hotel i guess. Hence, this hotel can be considered as Korean hotel. There is SPA within hotel compound and i would say that is the only plus for this hotel. You should try the SPA though but don't get ur expectation too high on its decorations.

It felt like I had my home office again. The hotel does not look like much from the outside but when you come in it is like a MUSEUM! So many contemporary art pieces.\n\nI enjoyed my stay here a lot. The facilities and amenities were well kept, I would argue this was the fanciest hotel I have been to in Myanmar by price. The amenities feel like it is at least 3.5 star, but this hotel is actually just a 2 star.\n\nElectricity is always on 24/7 and the internet is pretty decent. I had zoom calls without much lag!\n\nOne downside though is every service here is EXPENSIVE. Laundry, food, breakfast are all above average priced. The only saving grace is that they give you free airport transfers. But I guess that is their business model, cheap brief layover stays.\n\nAlso, they tried to keep my passport safe for me in a folder. I didn't appreciate that at all, they should have brought me my passport back as soon as they didn't need it! I had to ask for it back...\n\nFinally, the location (aside from being close to the airport) is horrible. Only 2 restaurants are nearby and they are both average at best, with one being better because if pricing. No convinient stores at all, you can't buy snacks or any thing else you need like shampoo without taking a taxi to the middle of the city.\n\nOverall it was a good stay, I would comeback again a day before my next flight out of Myanmar.

While the hotel boasted some commendable aspects, there were also notable areas that fell short of expectations.\n\nUpon arrival, I was greeted by a courteous receptionist who efficiently checked me in. The lobby exuded a sophisticated ambiance with its modern decor and comfortable seating areas. However, the check-in process felt slightly disorganized, with a longer wait time than anticipated.\n\nEntering my room, I was initially impressed by its cleanliness and spacious layout. The bed was comfortable, and the linens appeared fresh. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed some signs of wear and tear, such as scuff marks on the furniture and a few stains on the carpet. Additionally, the room lacked certain amenities that are becoming standard in many hotels, such as a coffee maker and mini-fridge.\n\nThe bathroom, while adequately sized, had outdated fixtures and could benefit from a renovation. The water pressure in the shower was inconsistent, alternating between strong bursts and weak dribbles. Furthermore, the toiletries provided were of subpar quality, failing to meet the standard expected from a hotel of this caliber.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's dining options. The breakfast buffet offered a variety of delicious dishes, ranging from traditional favorites to international selections. The restaurant staff were attentive and accommodating, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. However, the prices were on the higher side, and I felt that the value for money could have been better.\n\nThe hotel's amenities left much to be desired. While there was a fitness center available, it was small and poorly equipped. Additionally, the pool area was underwhelming, with limited seating and a lack of ambiance. It seemed as though these facilities were an afterthought rather than a focal point of the hotel's offerings.\n\nIn terms of location, the Riverview Hotel was conveniently situated near several attractions and transportation options. However, the surrounding area was noisy, especially at night, which detracted from the overall tranquility of the stay. Furthermore, parking was limited and expensive, adding an extra inconvenience for guests with vehicles.\n\nOn the service front, the staff were generally friendly and helpful, although there were instances where communication was lacking. For example, requests made to the front desk were sometimes forgotten or took longer than expected to fulfill. Additionally, housekeeping could be inconsistent, with some days seeing thorough cleanings while others left much to be desired.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Riverview Hotel was a mixed bag. While there were aspects to appreciate, such as the dining options and cleanliness of the rooms, there were also notable shortcomings, including outdated facilities and inconsistent service. With some improvements in these areas, the hotel has the potential to elevate its rating and provide a more satisfying experience for guests."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ko Kyaw"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXk3SOvIliN7feYgaUVVkur6fMkjVbC2q0sbZDoKcRXWKV7QYwoCw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Very well decorated.

The rooms are clean and maintained well. They even have an ATM in the lobby. There is a 24hour CityMart (local supermarket) nearby. Since the hotel is on the main road, you can easily get Grab (like Uber car sharing service) and go around the city.\n\nDo read my previous review below:\n\n*****************************\nOld review from 2017 below:\n\nWe stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in the Superior twin room and 2 nights in the Junior Suite B with Bathtub. As most of the reviews have already mentioned,  choose the rooms towards the back of the hotel (away from the road) and preferably to the right (facing east), these rooms have a better view and also you will get a glimpse of the rising sun. The hotel's buffet breakfast is great and each day they have a special local cuisine. This, in my opinion, would be a very safe way to try out the local dishes. The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained. The only problem is  that the doors do not appear to be sound proof and could be a problem if there are a lot of guests moving in-and-out of their rooms. TIP: There is a City Mart outlet straight down the road, about 15mins walk. There is a hospital nearby. There are some great food places in about 15mins walk.

Given that the price (USD 30) was quite competitive for hotels near Yangon airport, and even though there were no Tripadvisor reviews available so far, we gave this place a chance. Unfortunately, we cannot recommend this hotel.||The hotel is located next to a major road while the windows do not absorb much of the noise produced by the heavy traffic and the constant honking. Not the very best combination... When we arrived, we felt like staying in a tent in the middle of a freeway… Luckily, the traffic became less at night which means we slept better than expected.||One of the reasons we booked this hotel is that it seemd to be quite new. When we arrived, one of the receptionist confirmed that the hotel had been open for 8 months only. However, the bathroom in our room looked as if it had been in use for many years already.||The staff was quite friendly. However, as they only spoke very little English, it was difficult to communicate with them. The hotel seems to be frequented by Chinese guests – maybe the staff speaks Chinese.||When we arrived, we asked the staff to arrange a taxi to take us to the airport the next morning. The staff confirmed that a taxi will be arranged for MMK 5,000 (which is rather much for Yangon standards given that the ride was supposed to take no more than 15 minutes). The next morning, a taxi was ready to pick us up but asked that we pay MMK 7,000. The taxi ride took a little more than 15 minutes. As there was almost no traffic at 6:00 am, expect considerably more than that during rush hour.||Overall, our experience at Bayint Naung Hotel was not the very best one. There must be better options to stay at close to Yangon airport.||"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Sayar T Excellent"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUa7_hZYPPBph0OaMwrJnMkvl5xh9IVH1qbngqPKCVfZ-1corE=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":2,""Description"":""I would like to say not bad but it needs much in all round to be able to catch up with international ."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Thura Aung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWNP7_wbRz8c8C9iXucAqAFL67pYZYvtvrUdMSUKsqKOcYB3pqa=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Awesome Place and nice to stay.
