So in an apples-to-apples comparison, it is close to 3 stars. . .  but falls short in several ways. You be the judge:||The room was large and wasnt lacking for furniture, but the drapes were badly torn and the bedding had a lot of visible stains.  ||The plush headboard was likewise filthy and the pillows were very well used.||Moving on to the bathroom, the shower had plenty of hot water but 75% flowed out if the downspout, leaving the shower with rather weak pressure. The shower head was mounted below chest level. I brought these issues up with the staff on day 1, but there was no change during our time there.||Finally, the free breakfast. It was next door in a busy restaurant. There is a choice of 4 set menus with no changes allowed (it is not a buffet). Most hotels (every one we have stayed at in Yangon) have a buffet. The restaurant wouldn't even give us water, only tea or coffee (which I doubt is from filtered water). The water at the hotel is turbid (a light brown color), and I imagine that is what you get with the tea/coffee.||We brought our own bottled every morning which was not a problem.||I would give details about the number of flies in the restaurant, but suffice it to say that if you dont like flies buzzing everywhere, you might want to avoid the place.||The location (walking distance to the lake) was ok. A longer walk to other restaurants (with the exception of a Thai restaurant just across the street which was excellent).||All in all, I'd like to give it 3 stars. The house is nice.

Rooms were good, clean and well equipped. Breakfast was great, with omelettes cooked to order as well as the usual buffet fare. We travelled rounf Myanmar and returned to this hotel 2 weeks later to the same standard of service. Can't comment on the nearby ameneties, or the area in general as we were merely 'passing through' and needed a bed for the night. Overall, a good hotel with everything you need for a short stay.

As most of the reviews have already mentioned,  choose the rooms towards the back of the hotel (away from the road) and preferably to the right (facing east), these rooms have a better view and also you will get a glimpse of the rising sun. The hotel's buffet breakfast is great and each day they have a special local cuisine. This, in my opinion, would be a very safe way to try out the local dishes. The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained. The only problem is  that the doors do not appear to be sound proof and could be a problem if there are a lot of guests moving in-and-out of their rooms. TIP: There is a City Mart outlet straight down the road, about 15mins walk. There is a hospital nearby. There are some great food places in about 15mins walk.

Thanks to them I have a great experience in the country.\n\nThe location is pretty convenient too if you use the grab app, you can book a taxi and take a ride to downtown in about 10 minutes.\n\nThe room also has all the basic necessities and even come with free body wash and shampoo incase you run out as well as toothbrush.\n\nThe power may go out a few times but thats not their fault, its the countries power grid with rolling blackouts and they try to keep the power going with a generator I believe. The hot water in the shower is a little short but with how hot the country is it didn't bother me.\n\nHopefully they see this so thank you Asian Smile Hotel!!!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Myo Myint oo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXOmactE_SsuEBl2unndIH-zfOLgexF7ZWcsQAWzZo2mqLLULTKcA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Wide and clean room.

We checked-in around 3PM. Says you can check-in starting at 2PM. But when we arrived, the room wasn't quite ready yet. They were still fixing the water heater. They informed us that we'll be able to use hot water by night-time. The Side Table and Stools weren't even arranged properly when we arrived. We specifically requested the lake view room but was allocated at the 5th floor where the lake can't be seen as it's covered by trees. Still we get the view of Shwedagon Pagoda though. The room was hot, humid and a bit dusty when we checked in. Bed sheets are stained in some places but we didn't complain. What I was disgusted most by is the mold in Shower Curtains. Yuck! And hair remains in the bathtub and floor near the bed. At night, I turned on hot water and all I got was air, rusted brown water and cold water. I called them to check and they came in claiming the water is usable and is warm. It wasn't. Don't let me start with the room key card... Works 1 out of 30 tries. They came to change batteries both in the evening and the next morning. Every time we get out of the room we get locked out even though we have the key card with us. The only good thing was the tasty breakfast with a wide variety to choose from. Even for breakfast, the dining room arrangement sucked. They put two extra tables and chairs close to the buffet table and we have to tuck through these to get the food. Ugh... And they rang the doorbell at 7 AM mistakenly with the next room who were to check-out that morning. Didn't even say they were sorry for the interruption. We were given breakfast tickets but when we arrived at the dining room, no one was there to collect it so we left these tickets on the table after we were done eating. Guess what? They called us at 9AM and said it was the last call for breakfast. Good that they remind us for Breakfast, bad that they suck at who has finished eating and who have not. Overall, it seems overrated and overpriced compared to other hotels in town. Maybe they treat us locals differently from foreigners, not sure about that, as the room rates for locals and foreigners are different. But I think, for the same price, there are many hotels out there that give better service and facilities than those provided here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTjv-D6zKesrZz3a9TCruPYLhsrV5_JvBM9upK\u0026fid=0x0:0xf4763ad7a8ba89c5""],""When"":""2023-6-3""}]",

I have to greet good morning first.\n\nRoom/ 3 Stars - made a reservation with a confirmation of Premier room with king bed size in advance but they gave me twin joint bed, normally I won’t have any problem either King or twins Zipped bed however under the twin zipped bed, they placed normal sponge sheets which very hot and uncomfortable to sleep on. When I complained they said it was their standard.\n\nRoom Cleanliness/ 2 stars - a lot of previous guests hair (all type of hair) in under the floor and a lot of dust on the table. Extra pillow also very dirty, there was still on spot of stained on pillow, Look like a stained of human sperm.\n\nWhen I called Front office staff and show him how bad the room was arranged, they finally switch with another but have to wait 3 more hours to be able to move to new room. Now room was not very different about cleaning, i was also stepped on a piece of glass which the housekeeper didn’t do their job well. Also still have hair on the floor for a newly clean room.\n\nBreakfast/ 3 Stars - normal, not much choice.\n\nBellman - leaked of concentration. I was waiting for grab and when the grab arrived with another passengers, he opened the door for those passengers and when I was able to go in, he just closed the door. I was shocked for a second.\n\nHotel Location is Great which surrounding with restaurants.\n\nSuggest: please train the housekeepers well, ohh need to train the supervisor first. Lastly their supervisor should be on site randomly checking after the room was cleaned, not just out of the hotel."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOonXGvdUne_JcQ88h0MrGx85NKVzEDvCtsYpM2\u0026fid=0x0:0x1baa65eaa3c2b6c9""],""When"":""2024-3-18""}]",
