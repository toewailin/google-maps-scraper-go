The first hotel I booked at $20 per night was an absolute dive. I got out of there as quickly as I could! Walked into Hotel Bond having checked it out online, yes it was a higher price, but worth every penny. The staff were so welcoming when I turned up at 8 in the morning, got me settled into a room and even invited me to have breakfast. The staff carried my suitcase up the stairs and even with the shared bathroom, i never saw the other guest sharing the bathroom so there was no conflict there. The bathroom was excellent with a rainforest shower and a smaller shower head. My suggestions here would be to get some bigger shampoo and shower gel bottles, the tiny individual ones are a waste of plastic and in this case space given that it is a shared bathroom. Putting some floor mats for the bathroom would also be a good idea, 2-3 so each room can have their own.||The room was small but very comfortable and clean.||The breakfast was decent and the daily noodle dish was always vegetable only which is just perfect!||My only other recommendation would be large water refills. Whilst having large water bottles as well as small is a big step above most hotels, I would prefer to use no plastic at all. When I asked the guy at the desk where I might refill my bottle, he said he didn't know and to maybe try a pagoda, when I walked out the door it was less than 30 seconds before I saw that there are water tanks on the street all over the place and these are for anyone to use!
