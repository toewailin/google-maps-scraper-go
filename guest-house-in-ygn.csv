It’s basic, but the taste was superb. WiFi is really good for Myanmar, you could even watch Netflix!|I saw some double rooms and they are nice, with balcony and space. I slept in a single and that is below par. It is clean and with toilet, warm water, fridge, airco but without a window, just one TL lamp. But the one star lost is because of the noice. I heard everyone and everything indoors during the night. From 6am on, even ear plugs give up. They ask a bit too much for this room (14)||This is a great spot, but avoid the cheapest rooms."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Urdax Ugarte"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVtTWGxKgXqGKQtqf7yJosymj1yhnBNenG9Gn3_GpvrOJS3IFyA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We were lucky to get the front room that comes with AC and big windows overlooking the quiet street.

We are used to living rough - we stayed at a couple local villages with no indoor plumbing, minimal electricity, and felt the accommodations were much nicer than at Shwe War.||We would give the staff a sold 4/5 stars, but the facilities and experience were a generous 2/5. ||The Good||We loved the staff! Everyone was lovely, attentive, flexible and kind. We were greeted warmly and with smiles every time we arrived or departed the hotel. They were quick to accommodate all of our needs and allowed a late check out at no extra cost. |||The Bad||Breakfast was pretty terrible. I guess we shouldn’t have ordered the more western breakfast and instead opted for local fare, which may have made a huge difference. White bread egg sandwich with velveta style American cheese that had cucumber and...ketchup?||The room was roomy and had most everything we needed, but the bed was rock hard and we found ants on our comforter after arriving. We were told that we had probably left something on the bed and that’s why ants had arrived. But whatever the case, this was a massive turn-off and left us feeling very uneasy about sleeping in the room. To their credit, they had a group of staff members to our room within minutes of making the phone call to complain and changed the linens and sprayed ant spray around the floor. We suggested a new room but they said ours was the best room.||The carpet also left a lot to be desired. It had lots of stains from glitter, glue(?), and dead bugs embedded into the fabric. The bathroom was awful as well. Shower hardware was broken so I had to squat to rinse my head and hold the shower for my wife who has an injured shoulder. There was also mold on the bathroom walls, sticky gunk on the mirror, and the sink drain barely worked. |||"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""OeivindSlaatto"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QfCm-MBS7Itwd4h-55xcyygsVKq1IZbUTNyg17UKkQsT2C3oSXBlQ_-pGTl8imnrFVtVw=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""I stayed here with my partner for 11 days while working in Yangon.

First, let us start with the price, for less than US$150 for 4 days and 3 nights it is definitely a winner. Plus lots of freebies in the room like water, coffee, tea etc. The reception is very accommodating and Ted was very helpful in booking our Grab wherever we go. He always makes it a point that the driver knows where to take us and even talks to the driver just to be sure. Our room is always kept clean, tidy with clean sheets. Our friends who visited us were surprised with how affordable and yet our room is big enough, comfortable and safe.  We definitely recommended Golden Guest Inn to our friends who are visiting Yangon and will continue to recommend them because its like our second home away from the Philippines.
