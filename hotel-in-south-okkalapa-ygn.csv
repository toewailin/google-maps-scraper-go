No checking of whether did we enjoy the service and how did we experience.  ||Later, I told me daughter to check the rooms while we are here. The receptionist did not reply to our request whether there is a show room available.

If the basic honoring of guest's booking can so easily be comprised, how can we ever trust this hotel again? To make things worse, we even went down personally to the hotel a few days before our check in date to ensure the hotel has our booking correctly received due to the prior similar incident happened in December 2018 when the hotel also says no room for us after we booked the rooms.

Rooms were good, clean and well equipped. Breakfast was great, with omelettes cooked to order as well as the usual buffet fare. We travelled rounf Myanmar and returned to this hotel 2 weeks later to the same standard of service. Can't comment on the nearby ameneties, or the area in general as we were merely 'passing through' and needed a bed for the night. Overall, a good hotel with everything you need for a short stay.

Since the hotel is on the main road, you can easily get Grab (like Uber car sharing service) and go around the city.\n\nDo read my previous review below:\n\n*****************************\nOld review from 2017 below:\n\nWe stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in the Superior twin room and 2 nights in the Junior Suite B with Bathtub. As most of the reviews have already mentioned,  choose the rooms towards the back of the hotel (away from the road) and preferably to the right (facing east), these rooms have a better view and also you will get a glimpse of the rising sun. The hotel's buffet breakfast is great and each day they have a special local cuisine. This, in my opinion, would be a very safe way to try out the local dishes. The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained. The only problem is  that the doors do not appear to be sound proof and could be a problem if there are a lot of guests moving in-and-out of their rooms. TIP: There is a City Mart outlet straight down the road, about 15mins walk. There is a hospital nearby. There are some great food places in about 15mins walk.

The most important thing to know going in is that this is a fairly small hotel. The lobby is quite compact, and even though there is a couch there usually are 2-4 people hanging out (I could never tell if they were all hotel employees or just friends). ||||For both stays I was given room #8004, right around the corner from the front desk. It might be the largest room in the hotel - there was a big, flat-screen TV, some comfortable chairs, a twin bed, and a double bed. The air conditioning was pretty strong but could be adjusted with the remote. For the first 3-4 nights there were a couple of mosquitoes that had gotten into my room somehow which made sleeping a bit difficult (I tend to attract them) in spite of the A/C being on.||||The bathroom is small but totally functional. I appreciated the modern fixtures, especially the square-shaped sink with a fairly deep basin. No problems with hot water or water pressure.||||Breakfast is served on the roof where there is an indoor eating area as well as outdoor tables. The manager, U Shwe (Mr. Gold), has done a nice job turning the outdoor space into something of a sanctuary by stringing vines and plants over the balcony so that you don't really see the busy and dusty street below. It's very green and pretty comfortable, but it's the only place to \""hang out\"" and is not free from mosquitoes since it's outside.||||The choices at breakfast are quite diverse and do rotate, so if you stay for a few days you'll see different dishes. Mostly Myanmar-style food with rice, noodles (usually oily), vegetables, soup, a couple of meat dishes, etc. though there is fruit and a couple of different bread products with butter and jam. U Shwe is always at breakfast and does a great job making guests feel at home, even to the point of plating food for them and bringing it to the table. His English is excellent and he's very helpful, so if you have any questions and/or need assistance of any kind be sure to seek him out.||||The location of this hotel is a half-block off of a busy street (Yadanar Road) that doesn't have a sidewalk and isn't really walkable. There is a Chinese/Thai-style restaurant just half a block up that is a good option if you don't want to eat at the Royal Ruby. It's on the same side of the street and serves decent food. ||||There is free wi-fi at the Royal Ruby, but as is often the case in Myanmar the connection seems to go in and out randomly. I was unable to connect with my iPhone but had no problem with my laptop, and in the mornings (before 9am) and evenings (after 7pm) the connection on my laptop was pretty good.||||The only reason I stayed at this hotel was because it is close to the offices of the organization that hosted me during my stay. It's not one that I normally would choose for myself, but it was perfectly adequate for most of my needs. Since there is no fitness center I took a taxi to Real Fitness on Pale Road just west of Kabar Aye Pagoda Road in Bahan. They charge US$20 for a session during weekdays and US$30 on weekends...pretty steep, but I really needed a workout.||||If I go back to Yangon and need to be in this part of town, I most likely would choose to stay at the Sedona Hotel. If you need something a bit on the cheaper side, though, the Royal Ruby should work for your needs. My room was US$60/night (payable in cash, even though there's a MasterCard sign at the reception desk) which apparently is standard for that class of hotel in Yangon. The best thing about the Royal Ruby is U Shwe - I wouldn't even have bothered reviewing this property if he hadn't been such a great resource.||||P.S. I left a piece of luggage at the hotel while I traveled to Inle Lake and Bagan and stopped by to pick it up five days later. No problem with that."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mel G"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0Qf66pF81jsVXBxevYxxL5FsdlDsKAngAUpJVE-hAwai1rl8J0QnYqktKV3UGdpbmNlc_A=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""The royal Ruby is anew hotel just a year old, it has 39 rooms, the receptionist speaks workable English and the manager check every room for cleanliness everyday twice he insists and as I seem home running around checking things and training his new staff one and half hours every day it's a bit like being in hotel training school as everyone tries to help in this B and B trying to go up market. I had difficulty trying to organise flights on the Internet to Mruak U and after the receptionist used the phone a friend option a taxi driver with good English turned up and drove me to the airline office and a money changing shop to get the best rate which it was it turned out. The rooms are spotless with that Asian guesthouse eyesore to most westeners the wet bathroom. Yep when you use the shower if you can stop splashing the toilet if you stand up western shower not squat Asian wash style. I was the only non Asian in the place. They gave me a said count for travelling alone, I didn't,t ask for it. There is the mini bar and flat screen and individual air on unit that was all working as we'll as power adapter and multipoint charging station. Free wifi and about dial in speed which I think is not their limitation. Breakfast is certainly set up for Asian with the congee soup, noodles and there is always the eggs and toast to fall back on. The Asian sweetened bread is not my cup of tea so perhaps I should have stuck to the local fare but wanted to try the western option. There is a very good oriental restaurant about fifty yards away with dim sum on Sunday and some of the best and fastest food service for an experienced foodie. No pool or gym only it's own dining room but clean safe secure and cooperative. A cab ride to town is cheap the driver they organised with good English took me for the days travel for not much more than my original rip off airport connection.

There was also no construction when I was there. My room is huge (and ceiling high), the television is so far away (8-10m) from my bed I have problem seeing the details. In contrast my hotel room in the city centre was so small that the TV is mounted like 80cm from the bed and they have to put it near the ceiling to increase the distance. The rooms are very well furnished (best value for money IMHO) and bigger than the family room that I had booked at the nearby Crystal Palace Hotel. It is a modern hotel with card entry. If you stay at the hotel you get a 20% discount at the Spa and the ONLY treatment I would recommend is the traditional massage at 10,000 kyat before discount. The Monalisa Restaurant (Level 1) is actually excellent and reasonably priced that I ended having dinner there every night. The breakfast is not excellent but quite good. There is actually an omelette counter so you can have you eggs done in any way but I did not see any eggs swimming in grease.||While the Wifi is not great, the signal is relatively strong and it is actually better than most hotels in Myanmar. Internet speed is not fast in the whole country and may break off.||Having stayed at various locations in Yangon, I can say this hotel is very centrally located. You can walk to visit Chauk Htat Gyi and Nga Htat Gyi Pagodas and be back within 2 hours without rushing. Shwedagon is also within walking distance.Downtown and Kandawgyi Lake are also not far away.  ||The best thing about this hotel is the hot water. You get very hot water very fast, better than some 5 star hotels.||Try not to venture to the basement as it is a \""Love Tunnel\"" mostly for the local businessmen. The hotel staff is helpful, friendly and professional. Highly recommended, it is unbeatable at the price I paid. The only negative about this hotel is that there are no shops, shopping centres or amenities nearby. There is a diesel generator planted at the entrance of the hotel so any electrical outages are very short."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

We chose your hotel after carefully comparing reviews and services from other options, but unfortunately, the experience fell short of our expectations and what the reviews suggested.\n\nFirstly, we called ahead at noon to inquire about early check-in but were told it wasn’t possible. We understand that early check-in is subject to availability, but this was disappointing. We checked in at 2 p.m. as directed.\n\nDuring the check-in process, the reception team did not thoroughly verify our booking details. They requested full payment upfront despite our prior payment of half the charges via Kpay. We had to remind them to recheck the information, which was frustrating and could have easily been avoided with better attention to detail.\n\nSecondly, our room was not ready upon arrival, even though we had informed the reception in advance of our arrival time. When escorted to the room, the staff knocked before entering, which raised concerns about whether they were unsure if the room was properly assigned to us. Additionally, the key card provided didn’t work, leaving us waiting outside for an extended period. The staff eventually opened the room with a master key but left us with the malfunctioning card instead of replacing it with a functional one. This was not only inconvenient but also unprofessional.\n\nThe state of the room itself was also disappointing. The bed was not properly organized, and the decorative pillows and blanket shown in your promotional photos were haphazardly stored in the wardrobe rather than being arranged on the bed. This lack of attention to detail made us question whether the room had been properly cleaned after the last guest’s stay. The staff member assisting us also did not offer any information about the facilities, and their tone and demeanor were far from what one would expect from hospitality staff. We felt disrespected and unwelcome.\n\nLastly, communication between staff was noticeably poor. Upon leaving for dinner, we informed the reception about the faulty key card and handed it over for replacement. However, when we returned, the staff on duty seemed unaware of the situation and even questioned whether we had handed in the key at all. This clear lack of communication between shifts added to our dissatisfaction.\n\nOverall,  the service we received was far from the standard we anticipated, and we hope these issues will be addressed for future guests."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Pearl Su"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKmPkagE-Z23PA_7GpkkzZQ94VuUT3WYlPp5b7EJRlt0Efunw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""It is located inside of the alley.

Putting some floor mats for the bathroom would also be a good idea, 2-3 so each room can have their own.||The room was small but very comfortable and clean.||The breakfast was decent and the daily noodle dish was always vegetable only which is just perfect!||My only other recommendation would be large water refills. Whilst having large water bottles as well as small is a big step above most hotels, I would prefer to use no plastic at all. When I asked the guy at the desk where I might refill my bottle, he said he didn't know and to maybe try a pagoda, when I walked out the door it was less than 30 seconds before I saw that there are water tanks on the street all over the place and these are for anyone to use! Hurrah! Still it would be great if the hotel included water refills in their breakfast room."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Poor Communication and Lack of Knowledge:\nWhen I called the hotel’s operator staff to inquire about a promotion I saw on their Facebook page, they were completely clueless. They acted like they weren’t even part of the hotel staff and had no knowledge of the promotion or anything related to the hotel. It was incredibly frustrating and unprofessional.\n\n2. Unwelcoming Reception:\nUpon checking in, I found the receptionists to be just as unhelpful and lazy as the operator staff. They were unwelcoming and didn’t provide any information about the hotel, such as breakfast timings or amenities. It felt like they couldn’t care less about their guests.\n\n3. Horrible Room Conditions:\nThe room was absolutely appalling. It smelled awful, and the duvet cover was full of stains. It was clear that cleanliness and guest comfort are not priorities at this hotel.\n\n4. Embarrassing Incident at the Pool:\nWhile my girlfriend and I were at the pool, a waiter invited us to enjoy a free BBQ. However, when I asked about the timings, a senior cashier rudely informed us that it was a staff party. This was an incredibly embarrassing and awkward moment. It’s shocking that the staff doesn’t even know their own guests and fail to communicate properly among themselves.\n\n5. Pathetic Breakfast:\nThe breakfast was a joke. There was only fried rice and bread available, yet they have the audacity to call it a “luxury hotel’s buffet.” It was far from it. They should just call it à la carte and be done with it.\n\nOverall, my stay at Royal Tian Li was a nightmare. The staff is unprofessional and untrained, the rooms are dirty, and the amenities are far below any acceptable standard. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kelly C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QdCjMUwIiBikRhCLHgN_0vyGAo1GvT8DEukiKQb1ujC_eFsFjYrQ0OvLoSxPtqmCdgvFA=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""This hotel is perfect for a staycation.
