Poor Communication and Lack of Knowledge:\nWhen I called the hotel’s operator staff to inquire about a promotion I saw on their Facebook page, they were completely clueless. They acted like they weren’t even part of the hotel staff and had no knowledge of the promotion or anything related to the hotel. It was incredibly frustrating and unprofessional.\n\n2. Unwelcoming Reception:\nUpon checking in, I found the receptionists to be just as unhelpful and lazy as the operator staff. They were unwelcoming and didn’t provide any information about the hotel, such as breakfast timings or amenities. It felt like they couldn’t care less about their guests.\n\n3. Horrible Room Conditions:\nThe room was absolutely appalling. It smelled awful, and the duvet cover was full of stains. It was clear that cleanliness and guest comfort are not priorities at this hotel.\n\n4. Embarrassing Incident at the Pool:\nWhile my girlfriend and I were at the pool, a waiter invited us to enjoy a free BBQ. However, when I asked about the timings, a senior cashier rudely informed us that it was a staff party. This was an incredibly embarrassing and awkward moment. It’s shocking that the staff doesn’t even know their own guests and fail to communicate properly among themselves.\n\n5. Pathetic Breakfast:\nThe breakfast was a joke. There was only fried rice and bread available, yet they have the audacity to call it a “luxury hotel’s buffet.” It was far from it. They should just call it à la carte and be done with it.\n\nOverall, my stay at Royal Tian Li was a nightmare. The staff is unprofessional and untrained, the rooms are dirty, and the amenities are far below any acceptable standard. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kelly C"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QdCjMUwIiBikRhCLHgN_0vyGAo1GvT8DEukiKQb1ujC_eFsFjYrQ0OvLoSxPtqmCdgvFA=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""This hotel is perfect for a staycation.

The staff did everything they could to make us feel very comfortable and welcome in their hotel. The restaurant served a variety of food for the included breakfast buffet. There was also an available lunch or dinner menu which was reasonable in price and the food was fairly good as well.  The room accommodations were reasonable and very similar to other hotels we have stayed at in the area. We did wind up moving rooms towards the end of our stay into a larger suite. This made our stay much more comfortable at the end. The location of the hotel is very easily accessible from the airport and to the north and east side of the city.The new Myanmar Plaza is only about 15 minutes taxi ride and was very convenient for shopping, additional dining, and to pick up bottled water or other sundries as needed. The staff did a very good job of helping us manage taxi rides and directions and were very helpful with their ability to speak English as well. During our stay there Internet connection was not available and did produce some challenges for us. There seems to be something lost in translation as to why the Internet was not working but it appeared that maybe because it was the slow season they had disconnected the Internet because of the cost and the low number of visitors during our stay. Overall, we had a very reasonable stay and always looked forward to getting back to the hotel at the end of the day after we had been out and about. Despite some of the challenges with the Internet, the staff was very helpful and we may consider staying there again.  You would not go wrong if this were a short stop over or overnight stay while connecting through at the airport.

However, the staff were friendly and helpful too.

However, for someone looking for accommodation in the vicinity of the airport, the Golden View Hotel may be an acceptable choice for a short layover IF they do not want to go to the city. The hotel is quite new and the premises clean. Rooms are small but comfortable with air-con, flat-screen TV, minibar and safe. The bathrooms are simple but nice and there is a full set of amenities on offer. Wifi is free and offers acceptable coverage - at least in the Myanmar context of perennially slow and unstable internet connections. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a restaurant on its premises. The selection of food and beverage will cover basic needs for a short-term stay. The hotel is situated on the banks of Ngammoeyeik Creek, a tidal tributary to Yangon River in otherwise rather poor-looking surroundings. Unless you intend to rough it out, eating places that will fit the average tourist's basic needs are rare around the hotel. There is a bakery shop with cafe at the beginning of U Wisara Road (some 2.5km away). It is very popular among locals and serves decent food for a snack. For a proper meal you may want to move closer to town. Getting a taxi is not difficult at any time because for some reason there are plenty of taxis driving along U Wisara Road. Apart from the remote location (in relation to downtown Yangon), the other drawback of this hotel were that noise travelled easily along its corridors and through the light doors. If your stay coincides with that of a Korean or Chinese travel group, chances are that light sleepers will have to wake up at the same time. During the time of our stay, there was work being done in the environs of the hotel adding further to the noise level. ||Breakfast was included and included a standard selection of fruit, eggs, toast, cake, fruit punch (called “juice”), congee and some warm dishes etc. ||In conclusion: Similar to Sri Lanka after the end of the civil war, Myanmar’s hospitality industry went off the rails when it benefited from a sudden swelling of tourist arrivals after the opening of the country some three years ago. Prices for accommodation have more than doubled. They may not be exorbitantly high but I like to compare all deals with what you get in Thailand because it is the place where you get the best value-for-money if you look for it and most people can relate to this popular destination. Everything I have come across this trip, cannot remotely compare with what you get in Thailand for the same price."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Chuck Huckaby"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpbWZRZuxWnvS4180mBywsGxRjQ1la5FKeg3UQGuRJcFIq8GUNxg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Just a short ride from the new Yangon International Airport, the Royal Golden View is a fine hotel with free breakfast.

As Yangon hotels goes it's pretty good for the price. You can spend a lot more and get the same thing. Myanmar has only been \""open\"" for a few years and so they still do some annoying things the \""closed\"" way, however, it is getting better. But if you are expecting something like you would get in BKK or HKG or SIN then you'll be disappointed. However, all in all, this is the best for the price I've stayed at in YNG in my history there going back 9 years.||||Good Points||1. Clean. Rooms and hallways are clean and well lit.||2. Staff is friendly, however, is hampered by the rules laid down by someone who is not on the premises. The staff has no authority to do anything on their own.||3. GREAT hot water showers. Each room has its own HW heater. Good volume, clean water, well heated.||4. GREAT bathrooms. New, clean. It is a \""wet\"" bathroom but it is so much better than anything you are likely to get anywhere else outside of YNG. Getting back to this shower after a week elsewhere was the highlight of my trip.||5. Good Price. I paid $65 USD Cash for double occupancy. You must have cash and it must be cash that is in good shape. No marks. No tears. No dirt. They will simply refuse to accept anything that is not 95% perfect, so carry clean bills.||6. Fridge in the room. Good size TV. Air conditioning. Decent bed. Good sheets. Clean sheets. Great pillows. Good lighting in the room. Recessed LED ceiling lights. Well lit.||||Before I get to the Not So Good points. I did not eat at the hotel. I did not order any food there. I did not go to the restaurant. ||||Not So Good:||1. The AC in the rooms is VERY diverse depending on what room you get. We rejected 2 or 3 rooms before settling on one where the AC worked well. They will tell you, \""wait 20 minutes and it will get cool\"".  So wait and se what happens.||2. The southwest facing rooms (front) are into the sun most of the day. The inside of the windows are so hot you can't touch them. The second floor is worse. The heat coming into the room from the balcony door, or window or even through the wall is amazing. It will make these rooms 20 degrees hotter then the other side of the hotel. If you have to have a SW facing room take the ground floor as the trees outside provide a bit of shade. However, the lobby noise may get to you.||3. Noisy. There are signs up all over the hallways asking people to be quiet. The walls are not insulated and are all cement or tile and it echoes around the place. Wear earplugs to bed.||4. Cash. You must have USD cash and it must be clean. If you say, \""This is all I have.\"" They still will not take a marked or barely worn or torn bill. The people at the desk are simply following orders and have no discretion in the matter. The boss will take it out of their pay if they take your bill.||5. Out of the way. The hotel is not near much of anything. Which is fine for me but may be bad if you are looking for shopping or restaurants.||6. English. Their English is fine if everything goes well, but if you have a problem or require something more than standard English they will struggle. However, they are very pleasant and look like they understand.||7. Internet is sketchy and slow and erratic.||||All in all it is the best for the price that I have found in Yangon so far. If you get a room where the AC works on the Northeast side, and you have been to the grocery store for your food, you can have a nice stay and get clean."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Some staff yelling other staff members in front of guests (not professional at all). Soon as I walk into my room which was 406, I hate the smell, the smell is unpleasant, cardboard top concerns are mould and some stuff are broken, the bed sheet smells a lot, the bathroom smells so bad and they did not clean them properly even after I told them to clean again on second day, the third day morning, I went down for breakfast and there was a hair in the noodle soup. The hotel needs lots of improvement, the hotel is far away from the city, if you are tourist I would suggest you to stay elsewhere in the city so you are not paying lots of transportation money.

Here are the reasons why:||First off, after a long day bus from Bagan, Holly Hotel was just a hop and a skip away from the Aung Mingalar Highway Bus Station (about 500m-1200m depending on where your bus arrives - Aung Mingalar Highway Bus Station is just massive!). My bus stopped about a 1.2km walk from Holly Hotel, but I was able to walk there within 15 mins (I'm a fast walker, and I had only a small little backpack). The hotel is ideal for transit by bus, and is equally convenient for transit by air (located only about 6km from the airport). For me, Holly Hotel was perfect, since I arrived to Yangon from Bagan by bus, and was set to depart by airplane the next afternoon. The hotel negotiated a flat fare taxi for me to the airport for 10,000 kyat, so I could safely spend out my remaining currency without being caught off guard.||On that note, there is a large shopping mall located 1.4 km up the road. It's called \""Terminal M,\"" and it has many restaurants/food courts, major retailers and most importantly a massive supermarket in the basement called \""Ocean Supermarket.\"" I walked to the supermarket from the hotel in about 15 mins (again, I'm a fast walker). It's safe to do so, just be aware you will be walking on the highway, so walk and cross the road with vigilance! I was able to spend out my remaining currency here, with great selection and prices!||Re: location, there are no food options nearby the hotel, so best be prepared for that! Unless you walk up to Terminal M, or come prepared with food for dinner at the hotel like I had done, you will find yourself in short supply. There are 2 small convenience stores across the street with basic supplies like water, crackers, cookies, instant noodles and other packaged foods which I couldn’t make out. The one convenience store directly adjacent has a big selection of wine! I was very happy to find wine in such an industrial area, and happily bought a bottle for a relaxing evening! Prices were reasonable.||Upon arrival at the hotel, I was greeted warmly by reception staff and check-in was swift. This was appreciated, since I had had a long travel day from Bagan!||My room was quite large, and very comfortable! Basic furniture such as a desk, chair, two bedside tables, and ample luggage storage (a large wooden bench and also a large wooden cabinet) were available! Air conditioning was strong, wifi signal was terrific (probably the best I've had in all of Myanmar so far), and the room was a welcome relief from the humidity. The room also came with a mini fridge (stocked with mini bar items such as water, a selection of sodas, and instant noodles), an electric kettle, 4-in-1 coffee (LOL, that's a first! Not sure what the 4th ingredient is!?), 2 coffee mugs, water glasses, 2 bottles of water with compliments, and 2 spoons.||Bathroom amenities included: 2 dental kits, 2 shower caps, bar soap, in shower shampoo and shower gel dispensers, and 2 combs. Toilet paper was in short supply, but staff were able to supply more when asked!||Shower and tap water were hot (perfect temperature) and water pressure was strong! Toilets were spotless!||Beds were super comfortable. Linens felt brand new and super clean. Pillows were the perfect firmness as was the mattress. Bedside lighting was also nice!||The room was equipped with flatscreen tv, with a few English channels to choose from - for one night, I was entertained enough! Sports channels namely, but there were also 2 movie channels in English as well.||The hotel has a cafe on the ground floor where breakfast is also served. It's called Holly Cafe! I didn't eat there, but prices looked reasonable. Breakfast buffet was fair, but not amazing, namely because I'm not one to enjoy Asian cuisine at breakfast (fried rice, noodles and greasy vegetables). I made do with what was on offer, as there were fried eggs, sautéed chicken breast with vegetables, fresh cut vegetables and fresh cut fruits available. Myanmar hotels mostly cater to Asian tastes, so one must be a bit flexible when traveling in this region! My only complaint would be the lack of availability of plain, no sugar added coffee/Nescafé (only 4-in-1 coffee packets were available), but I make it a point to carry my own in this region so I wasn't without.||Staff kindly allowed me to check-out an hour later, giving my time to regroup! They also helped me to remove the SIM card from my phone since I couldn't locate a paper clip or pin. Staff were extremely kind and helpful! ||Overall I enjoyed my stay at Holly Hotel! It was perfect for my transit needs, and allowed me a comfortable space to regroup, repack, and get organized for my next leg of travel! Excellent price to suit my budget also! But I also didn’t find accommodation in all of Myanmar to be terribly expensive either!||Thank you to all the staff for your kindness and hospitality! I loved Myanmar and will absolutely be back in the future!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Saothiha Htut"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV8KqBQ2mSbIhcBEccSxcNJqSW9tNc9EdjCEWtVKx5Vkk4wotFH=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""👍 Nice room, very tidy room and also in\nbathroom with toilet.\n👍 Near the highway station.\n👍 The room price is not expensive.\n👍 Air-conditioning is good."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN64PU6tD6HXPA12snSe4MsCVlyzP4tWrjJa7gl\u0026fid=0x0:0x650aee5bf9b2f242""],""When"":""2024-6-14""},{""Name"":""Gaurav Sancheti"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIk7vAPcfcQ5s5HNCwFF8fPbML5SGuLGwWvGOGkhfBqZLoTWA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The hotel staff is very polite and helpful.

In the evenings I often cannot even load a web page, or a sentence in Google translate. Or a picture in a news article. It's impossible to work or study. It's a low spot for our local Sim as well, so we can't even rely on that. We're not using a lot of data, web pages, zoom Mtgs and education apps. When I talked to the manager he made heaps of excuses. He tried to tell me the wifi situation was hard for them too... He talked about the situation in their country… I feel he's not being honest. How can they run their business if they can't load a web page each evening? It might be Burma, but that's a bit too much to believe. We're staying for 2 weeks!\nThe only plus was the good and complimentary laundry service. (it should be complementary too! We're paying a lot and not getting much value for money). I since discover that was a special deal for us, it's not usually complimentary.\nThe only reason we returned here is the location is suitable for us. But there's other hotels nearby and we're going to try another one. I hope I don't have to stay here again.\nI feel like the management, and therefore the staff, are not honest ) (The staff were lovely, friendly and helpful, but they have to do what the management says. They have to follow the rules.)\nThe hotel prefers you to pay in USD instead of local money (kyat), and they make the exchange rate heavily in their favour.

We arrived in Yangon early in the morning after a 9 hour bus ride from Bagan. The receptionist greeted us and was able to check us in, in no time. She gave us orange juice as refreshments afterwards she hand us our room key and wifi password. Once we're settled in the room we immediately check if the wifi is working but both our phones aren't able to connect so we went down to the receptionist and have it checked. She eventually rebooted the router and that solved the problem so in case you encounter the same problem when you get there just ask the receptionist to turn the router on and off to save time since they don't have any IT guy around to fix it. They have quite a lot of options for breakfast especially if you're an early bird and the dining room is nice compared to other hotels we've stayed at it is very accessible too it's just located beside the reception area or if you don't want to get pass reception there's a door on the far right side of the elevator at the ground level if you just went down from your room. Our room is clean and have large windows with views of houses and buildings. This hotel is situated on the quiet side of Yangon beside a Buddhist Monastery that's why we had a real good sleep. There's a 24 hour lift and no power outages, thank God. There's no iron/ironing board available to rent but the receptionist offered someone to have my clothes ironed for free she asked some guy to come up to pick up and deliver my clothes which is okay though I'd prefer to do it myself if possible. I just noticed that Internet in Myanmar is not very fast so don't expect a lot when it comes to that. They arranged a taxi to take us to the airport the next day but it is not a free service offered by the hotel. They do not have airport pick up and drop off fyi.

But it is located across the street from a decent sized super market (Orange Market) and there's a lot of street food to try at night in the area.||One negative was that some days, I did come back to my room at night to find a lizard crawling on the wall. There were a few days when I woke up to find worms on the bathroom floor, which were cleaned up during the day time.||One thing I would advise though, is not to leave cash in the room. I left $50 in cash by accident in a visible place inside an empty bag, and returned later that night to only find $40. The reason why I did not dock any points for this though is because I immediately let the management know, and the manager immediately called a meeting with all his employees to found out what happened. When he couldn't figure out who it was, he gave me $10 from his own pocket, which I refused, but he insisted.

The Monalisa Restaurant (Level 1) is actually excellent and reasonably priced that I ended having dinner there every night. The breakfast is not excellent but quite good. There is actually an omelette counter so you can have you eggs done in any way but I did not see any eggs swimming in grease.||While the Wifi is not great, the signal is relatively strong and it is actually better than most hotels in Myanmar.

Shwedagon is also within walking distance.Downtown and Kandawgyi Lake are also not far away.  ||The best thing about this hotel is the hot water.

The large building is quite unique with many rooms within. The building is spartan and decent within. The rooms are clean but spartan. Although there is air conditioning, be prepared for a noisy night of air con noise from the old units. The toilet is big but very rudimentary. Expect power failures and the flush not working. However, if you have basic plumbing skills, that could easily be fixed rather than calling on the reception. You may have a language barrier!! Beds and toilets are really retro, so are the light fixtures. There is a small TV set with many channels. If you enjoy old Korean dramas dubbed in the local vernacular, then it's will be entertainment!! Oh yes, no towels or soap is provided. Bring your own towels, toiletries, and yes your own toilet paper. Also, no drinking water is provided. If you need any of these, these have to be paid for I guess. Breakfast is very rustic with a piece of plain bread with a fired egg. Coffee comes in a 3-1 satchet. So bring your own food to supplement!! There is supposed to be wifi in a small corner of the lobby. But don't count on that. There is never a connection when I was there. So you will really enjoy the real world without the lure of the internet!! The surrounding buildings are a sight to behold!! It's a walk back to the past with very old buildings. Enjoy the local culture and the endless heavy traffic as you try to cross the 6 lanes road!! No pedestrian crossing unfortunately. Make sure you buy travel insurance before you attempt to cross the road!! There are small Internet cafés nearby and a new but small shopping mall. To enter the mall, you have to pass through a metal detector gate!! There is a small but nice cafe within walking distance which sells decent food!!

The most important thing to know going in is that this is a fairly small hotel. The lobby is quite compact, and even though there is a couch there usually are 2-4 people hanging out (I could never tell if they were all hotel employees or just friends). ||||For both stays I was given room #8004, right around the corner from the front desk. It might be the largest room in the hotel - there was a big, flat-screen TV, some comfortable chairs, a twin bed, and a double bed. The air conditioning was pretty strong but could be adjusted with the remote. For the first 3-4 nights there were a couple of mosquitoes that had gotten into my room somehow which made sleeping a bit difficult (I tend to attract them) in spite of the A/C being on.||||The bathroom is small but totally functional. I appreciated the modern fixtures, especially the square-shaped sink with a fairly deep basin. No problems with hot water or water pressure.||||Breakfast is served on the roof where there is an indoor eating area as well as outdoor tables. The manager, U Shwe (Mr. Gold), has done a nice job turning the outdoor space into something of a sanctuary by stringing vines and plants over the balcony so that you don't really see the busy and dusty street below. It's very green and pretty comfortable, but it's the only place to \""hang out\"" and is not free from mosquitoes since it's outside.||||The choices at breakfast are quite diverse and do rotate, so if you stay for a few days you'll see different dishes. Mostly Myanmar-style food with rice, noodles (usually oily), vegetables, soup, a couple of meat dishes, etc. though there is fruit and a couple of different bread products with butter and jam. U Shwe is always at breakfast and does a great job making guests feel at home, even to the point of plating food for them and bringing it to the table. His English is excellent and he's very helpful, so if you have any questions and/or need assistance of any kind be sure to seek him out.||||The location of this hotel is a half-block off of a busy street (Yadanar Road) that doesn't have a sidewalk and isn't really walkable. There is a Chinese/Thai-style restaurant just half a block up that is a good option if you don't want to eat at the Royal Ruby. It's on the same side of the street and serves decent food. ||||There is free wi-fi at the Royal Ruby, but as is often the case in Myanmar the connection seems to go in and out randomly. I was unable to connect with my iPhone but had no problem with my laptop, and in the mornings (before 9am) and evenings (after 7pm) the connection on my laptop was pretty good.||||The only reason I stayed at this hotel was because it is close to the offices of the organization that hosted me during my stay. It's not one that I normally would choose for myself, but it was perfectly adequate for most of my needs. Since there is no fitness center I took a taxi to Real Fitness on Pale Road just west of Kabar Aye Pagoda Road in Bahan. They charge US$20 for a session during weekdays and US$30 on weekends...pretty steep, but I really needed a workout.||||If I go back to Yangon and need to be in this part of town, I most likely would choose to stay at the Sedona Hotel. If you need something a bit on the cheaper side, though, the Royal Ruby should work for your needs. My room was US$60/night (payable in cash, even though there's a MasterCard sign at the reception desk) which apparently is standard for that class of hotel in Yangon. The best thing about the Royal Ruby is U Shwe - I wouldn't even have bothered reviewing this property if he hadn't been such a great resource.||||P.S. I left a piece of luggage at the hotel while I traveled to Inle Lake and Bagan and stopped by to pick it up five days later. No problem with that."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mel G"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0Qf66pF81jsVXBxevYxxL5FsdlDsKAngAUpJVE-hAwai1rl8J0QnYqktKV3UGdpbmNlc_A=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""The royal Ruby is anew hotel just a year old, it has 39 rooms, the receptionist speaks workable English and the manager check every room for cleanliness everyday twice he insists and as I seem home running around checking things and training his new staff one and half hours every day it's a bit like being in hotel training school as everyone tries to help in this B and B trying to go up market. I had difficulty trying to organise flights on the Internet to Mruak U and after the receptionist used the phone a friend option a taxi driver with good English turned up and drove me to the airline office and a money changing shop to get the best rate which it was it turned out. The rooms are spotless with that Asian guesthouse eyesore to most westeners the wet bathroom. Yep when you use the shower if you can stop splashing the toilet if you stand up western shower not squat Asian wash style. I was the only non Asian in the place. They gave me a said count for travelling alone, I didn't,t ask for it. There is the mini bar and flat screen and individual air on unit that was all working as we'll as power adapter and multipoint charging station. Free wifi and about dial in speed which I think is not their limitation. Breakfast is certainly set up for Asian with the congee soup, noodles and there is always the eggs and toast to fall back on. The Asian sweetened bread is not my cup of tea so perhaps I should have stuck to the local fare but wanted to try the western option. There is a very good oriental restaurant about fifty yards away with dim sum on Sunday and some of the best and fastest food service for an experienced foodie. No pool or gym only it's own dining room but clean safe secure and cooperative. A cab ride to town is cheap the driver they organised with good English took me for the days travel for not much more than my original rip off airport connection. I suspect the owner is still a general so you can't get away from that.

It is close to Yangon International Airport, however you must take a taxi (experience in itself) to get there. There is a dirty and busy street in front of the hotel, with buses operating, but for a foreigner the system of the buses is almost ununderstandable. Alternatively you can use Yangon Circular Railway, a great attraction in itself, which can bring you to the Yangon main station in about one hour (the train rides very slowly, but shows you the real life of Myanmar). Wai Bar Gi station is within walking distance from the hotel (about 20 mins), however be prepared to walk through a very poor neighborhood and on soil roads. Aung Mingalar Bus Terminal is about 600 m from the hotel. The hotel itself has very simple rooms (just bed, table with chairs, small TV set and a very simple bathroom), any view was destroyed during my visit by a construction. The road is very noisy, so it is better to keep windows closed, there is quite loud air-conditioning. The \""bathroom\"" is just another empty room with shower and toilet, no frills, and during my stay there was no hot water in my room (maybe they could have probably fixed it if I would tell them, but it was OK in those hot and humid days). Bed is OK, linen is provided. There is a free wi-fi, but working only downstairs in a small lobby. Simple breakfast is included in the price. There are several small shops around, where you can buy water and something to eat, however do not put hygiene under a microscope... The whole neighborhood is very poor, but that is simply Myanmar. But the people are very nice and some of them in the hotel try to speak some words in English, however they are not used to foreign visitors very much. If you are looking for a very cheap accommodation not far from the airport (which was my intention), this hotel can serve you, but be prepared for a very spartan conditions.

We stayed for 14 days, before and after our up-country road trip.  The rooms were big, bright and very clean with crispy white bed linen.  The king size bed was nice and comfortable.  Room 601, being the corner room, had views from both sides of the windows.  The hotel staff were very accommodating especially Hla Myo Thwe (reservations) and Ko Nay (male receptionist).  The doorman always opened the car door for us whenever we stepped in and out of a taxi, and would always help to carry our bags.  The hotel is situated conveniently in the Ahlone suburb and is a walking distance to places to eat.  There is a 24/7 convenience store across the main road at the corner of Forest Road where you can buy coke, milk and lots of snacks; and a telephone shop down Forest Road where you can get Burmese telephone SIM cards with unlimited internet data (very cheap).   The air conditioner in both the rooms are very powerful.  When you check-in, Reception gives you a code(s) for your smartphone/laptop devices, and depending on how many devices you have, you can ask for extra codes without any hassle.  The receptionist girls were extremely helpful in helping us with getting \""Grab\"" taxis and helping us download the \""Grab\"" App on our iPhones.  Grab taxis are like Uber taxis, safe, convenient and generally cheaper than normal taxis in Yangon.  The only negative things if I have to mention would be (1) the elevator is extremely slow and you have to wait for some time.  (2)  Breakfast caters more Asian food; western food is very limited.  Fried rice, fried noodles/vermicelli is served everyday and is boring when you are staying for more than 3-4 days.  (3)  In the bathroom there is no shower screen or divider/partition to stop the water from splashing and wetting the entire area.  This is a dangerous hazard as one can very easily have a bad fall from the wet and slippery bathroom floor.  Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely return to stay at Hotel 99 on our next Burma trip.

The strong water-pressure and instant hot water made the shower a wonderful experience. The bath was nice and spacious as well.||||The wifi was good, being better at night for some reason. I connected my Apple TV to the flat screen in the room and had no connectivity issues. Video calls with New Zealand also ran smoothly.||||Breakfast was a highlight every day. Prepared by Japanese chefs, the numerous and varied options were always fresh and of good quality. Again, the staff were friendly and more than happy to assist, even asking me if I had any special requests. Sure enough, my bacon was waiting for me the next morning.||||The hotel has a restaurant, gym and underground parking lot. It is a quick and convenient taxi ride away from Myanmar Plaza.

The first hotel I booked at $20 per night was an absolute dive. I got out of there as quickly as I could! Walked into Hotel Bond having checked it out online, yes it was a higher price, but worth every penny. The staff were so welcoming when I turned up at 8 in the morning, got me settled into a room and even invited me to have breakfast. The staff carried my suitcase up the stairs and even with the shared bathroom, i never saw the other guest sharing the bathroom so there was no conflict there. The bathroom was excellent with a rainforest shower and a smaller shower head. My suggestions here would be to get some bigger shampoo and shower gel bottles, the tiny individual ones are a waste of plastic and in this case space given that it is a shared bathroom. Putting some floor mats for the bathroom would also be a good idea, 2-3 so each room can have their own.||The room was small but very comfortable and clean.||The breakfast was decent and the daily noodle dish was always vegetable only which is just perfect!||My only other recommendation would be large water refills. Whilst having large water bottles as well as small is a big step above most hotels, I would prefer to use no plastic at all. When I asked the guy at the desk where I might refill my bottle, he said he didn't know and to maybe try a pagoda, when I walked out the door it was less than 30 seconds before I saw that there are water tanks on the street all over the place and these are for anyone to use! Hurrah! Still it would be great if the hotel included water refills in their breakfast room."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

On the good side, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. It is in a suburb next to Million Coins Restaurant. Across the street is a new soccer stadium. Otherwise, the neighborhood seemed safe but 'iffy.' Lots of poverty most everywhere in this country. A limited breakfast is included with the room price. There are four choices all of which include juice and powdered coffee.||||Questionable was the top floor where they did the laundry. I think there were two electric washers, but one lady was scrubbing towels on the roof floor. Another lady was ironing sheets. Washing was hung out in the air to dry. Standard stock in the bathrooms were packaged condoms, restocked when rooms were cleaned. Bathroom had a shower that soaked the entire bathroom floor since the small drain hole must have been too tiny. This is possibly similar to any third-world hotel which costs $28 per night.||||Worst was our confirmed reservation. We arrived at 1:00 am from a delayed flight. None of the three young men at the desk could speak English. Fortunately, our driver could speak Burmese. He told us that there were no rooms - sort of. Certainly they would not give us one. Possibly with condoms in the rooms caused our being sent away . . . who knows? We were given no help to find accommodations. Our driver (head of a school where we were teaching) allowed us to crash on a mat in his school office. Although a bit arrogant for me to say, no-one could speak English though the manager could somewhat communicate to us. ||||Depending on your expectations, it did not meet mine.

Vorallem bezüglich des Preis-Leistungs Verhältnisses. Haben Low Season Preis bekommen (High Season ist hier Februar, da Myanmar da Schulferien hat)|Chaung Tah (siehe separate Bewertung) ist ein Urlaubsort für die Einheimischen und Chinesische Touristen. ||Unserem Wunsch auf höherer Etage ein Zimmer zu bekommen (3 Stöckig), wurde entsprochen. |Die Sauberkeit müssen wir bemängeln. Handtücher seeehr fleckig (wirklich grenzwertig) und Bettwäsche auch. Die Decke ist nur eine zwischen 2 Bettlaken (zu allen Seiten offen) gepackte Lösung. Bett war gut. Matratze h3, das ist ok. ||In dem Gebäude über der Rezeption wird gebaut, das hört man aber nur am Tag. Nachts wurden wir nicht gestört. ||Das Personal war stets bemüht und jedem Wunsch den wir äußerten wurde nach Möglichkeiten entsprochen, wenn es auch oft seine Zeit brauchte mit Händen und Füßen zu erklären was man wollte, da Englisch in dieser Gegend kaum einer versteht oder spricht. Speisekarten und Beschilderungen sind max. auf Chinesisch oder nur Burmesisch. Sehr wenige weisen sie in Englisch aus. Wir waren hier echte Exoten als „Fraktion Weißbrot“ :-D||Wifi.. welches Wifi? Aktuell buhlen wohl noch die Anbieter um die Leitungen. Wifi funktionierte 98% der Zeit gar nicht. Würde wohl in einem Monat nicht mehr so sein. Auch Chaung Tah modernisiert erst seit kurzem... hier wird noch viel passieren bezüglich Hotel Angebot in den nächsten Jahren. Vll gibts ja auch irgendwann mal einen richtigen kleinen Supermarkt. ||Frühstück haben wir einmal mitgemacht. 6:30-9 ist uns einfach zu zeitig im Urlaub Auswahl auf Einheimische und Chinesische Gäste abgestimmt. Die Omlett Station ist sehr unscheinbar und haben wir fast übersehen (war aber unsere Rettung). Früchte nur Melone und Ananas (Melone schmeckte fischig)|Zu 97% alles herzhaft und zu chinesisch. Veggies haben hier ein dezentes Problem am Buffett ;)|Wem das Frühstück wie uns zu früh ist, geht schräg gegenüber in das „Happy Chaung Tha Motel \u0026 Restaurant“ -das Spanish Omelett und das normale Omlette (mit Tomate und Zwiebeln auf Wunsch), sowie die Fresh Fruit Juice und der Pancake waren sehr gut und machten gut satt. Preise super! (1-2€, also 1500-3000ks)||Die Preise in den umliegenden Restaurants sind ebenfalls sehr günstig :)|Nur bietet nicht jeder die Frühstücks Sachen an. Hier kann man sich zum Mittag- und Abendessen überall mal durchprobieren. ||Am Pool im Hotel: Bikini Verbot. |Frauen müssen sich wie in Myanmar üblich mit längerer Shorts und minimum Tshirt bekleiden, wenn der Pool Bereich (direkt vor der Lobby) genutzt werden möchte. Männer normal mit Shorts. Als emanzipiert geprägte Gesellschaft, greifen wir uns bei sehr „großen Körpern“ der Chinesischen Touristen am Pool, an den Kopf, da uns der Sinn fern liegt, wenn die Männer mehr Oberweite und viel weniger Ästhetik aufweisen als all die Damen (...)|Am Strand ist Bikini ok/erlaubt aber dieser lädt nicht dazu ein (siehe Chaung Tha Bewertung)|Praktiziert hier auch keiner. | |Der Lobby und Frühstücksbereich ist offen und nicht so schön gestaltet. Hat was von einer kahlen Kantine. Hier könnte mehr Flair durch Myanmar Style herrschen. ||Einen Safe bekamen wir auf Nachfrage. ||Mini Bar (Kühlschrank mit Getränken und guten Preisen) vorhanden. ||Balkon der Zimmer recht groß. Tür schließt nicht dicht. Eventuell Moskitos. |Das Bad der Deluxe Zimmer ist klein. Die Dusche hat keinen Vorhang und es wird immer alles nass = Nasszelle||Strom gibt es nur von 6-18 Uhr und von 13-16 Uhr|Wenn man das weiß, lädt man Kamera, Handy und Co über Nacht und lässt die Klima am besten bis zum Morgen laufen, damit es bis 9 Uhr noch angenehm zum schlafen ist. ||Von 15:3-16:30 gibt es ein mini Buffet mit Chinesischen Tee und Kaffee sowie Chinesischer Suppe. Dem konnten wir gar nichts abgewinnen aber fanden wir eine schöne Grundidee. ||Türen der Zimmer unmöglich leise zu schließen :(|Knallt sehr! Vor allem morgens. ||Beleuchtung im Zimmer für gemütliches Licht am Abend nicht vorhanden. Eine simple kleine Leuchte auf dem Nachtisch oder in einer Ecke fehlt.||Im März/April ist es hier Nachts warm aber sonst zb Jan und Feb wird es doch sehr frisch Abends und eine dünnes Jäckchen und eine lange dünne Stoffhose sind zu empfehlen, sonst friert man zu später Stunde im Restaurant oder beim  Bummeln. Die Einheimisch haben hier Abends und Nachts sogar dicke Wollmützen auf und stellen weise Daunenjacken an aber für sie ist es auch Winter. Fanden wir witzig anzusehen, da wir aus Dtl noch ganz andere Temp. gewöhnt sind. |||||Fazit: simple, relativ hübsche Zimmer. Bad sagt uns leider nicht zu und die Sauberkeit war mir nix... Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit!|Zufrieden waren wir hier aber in Summe der einzelnen Punkte nicht.

As others have said, this hotel is very close (5 minutes) from the Yangon airport and very convenient for an overnight stay pre-flight. The pick up and drop off were prompt and all we could hope for. I booked a standard room, and we were first put in a 3rd floor (top floor) room. This room would have been unbearable. These top rooms sit under a slanted roof that appeared to be uninsulated since we could see light shining through in places. This meant that the ceiling of the room (the roof) was one large radiant heater. The finish-out in the room and bathroom was less than expected as well. When I called downstairs to say the heat was unbearable, they quickly moved us to an upgraded 2nd floor room that was perfectly cool and much more nicely finished out, so all was good. Food was good if not remarkable. The pool was dingy looking, so we passed on that. There is a fitness center in a building across the parking lot, but it was very warm inside. We walked the street outside the compound: Some interesting bits, but definitely a suburban slum and no sidewalks. My 4-star rating would probably be a 3.5, but the location and free shuttle service are excellent for airport access and the upgraded room was very nice.
