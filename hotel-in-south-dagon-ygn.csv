The hotel staff was able to accommodate our request, and even agreed to reserve for us a room after we came back from our trip.

We arrived with empty stomache and were eagering looking for food, so we ate at the hotel restaurant. Not much variety, but surprisingly, the fried beehoon and rice were delicious. I had ordered one room service one day, it was fish and chips, and it was tasty too, although the fish they used had lots of bones, but basically the taste was yummy!||||Location wise, the hotel is near to the airport, and the hotel provide free transfer to and fro airport. That was very nice, and, the hotel is located near a famous food court, just next to it. Food was okay there but many people came to eat in the morning and noon.

Poor Communication and Lack of Knowledge:\nWhen I called the hotel’s operator staff to inquire about a promotion I saw on their Facebook page, they were completely clueless. They acted like they weren’t even part of the hotel staff and had no knowledge of the promotion or anything related to the hotel. It was incredibly frustrating and unprofessional.\n\n2. Unwelcoming Reception:\nUpon checking in, I found the receptionists to be just as unhelpful and lazy as the operator staff. They were unwelcoming and didn’t provide any information about the hotel, such as breakfast timings or amenities. It felt like they couldn’t care less about their guests.\n\n3. Horrible Room Conditions:\nThe room was absolutely appalling. It smelled awful, and the duvet cover was full of stains. It was clear that cleanliness and guest comfort are not priorities at this hotel.\n\n4. Embarrassing Incident at the Pool:\nWhile my girlfriend and I were at the pool, a waiter invited us to enjoy a free BBQ. However, when I asked about the timings, a senior cashier rudely informed us that it was a staff party. This was an incredibly embarrassing and awkward moment. It’s shocking that the staff doesn’t even know their own guests and fail to communicate properly among themselves.\n\n5. Pathetic Breakfast:\nThe breakfast was a joke. There was only fried rice and bread available, yet they have the audacity to call it a “luxury hotel’s buffet.” It was far from it. They should just call it à la carte and be done with it.\n\nOverall, my stay at Royal Tian Li was a nightmare. The staff is unprofessional and untrained, the rooms are dirty, and the amenities are far below any acceptable standard.

But there certainly is one for each type of exercise-lats, triceps, biceps, legs, and arms. But there is only about one for each which ain't that much but it gets the job done.\n\nRooms-we didn't get those typa \""expensive and luxurious\"" rooms and got a family room and a superior double bed. The family room was quite capacious but the superior one was quite small, might be due to the price but it's to be expected.\n\nService-A lil over average ova. The speed is consistent and when we ordered some snacks from the hotel, both time, the order were sent within 20min and the taste was restruant type quality and the prices were quite inexpensive considering the tax and service fees that were added ova.\n\nConclusion-A great hotel, was great for the price.

The room is very well designed – I especially liked the direct usb ports provided. Killed a couple of mosquitoes in the room, and my hot water shower takes a couple minutes to heat up. Faint KTV music can be heard through room insulation on weekend nights. The hotel massage was just ok, not as good as I read. ||||Regarding the WiFi, they’re using the daily password system which I hate as it almost always gives me problems.

There was also no construction when I was there. My room is huge (and ceiling high), the television is so far away (8-10m) from my bed I have problem seeing the details. In contrast my hotel room in the city centre was so small that the TV is mounted like 80cm from the bed and they have to put it near the ceiling to increase the distance. The rooms are very well furnished (best value for money IMHO) and bigger than the family room that I had booked at the nearby Crystal Palace Hotel. It is a modern hotel with card entry. If you stay at the hotel you get a 20% discount at the Spa and the ONLY treatment I would recommend is the traditional massage at 10,000 kyat before discount. The Monalisa Restaurant (Level 1) is actually excellent and reasonably priced that I ended having dinner there every night. The breakfast is not excellent but quite good. There is actually an omelette counter so you can have you eggs done in any way but I did not see any eggs swimming in grease.||While the Wifi is not great, the signal is relatively strong and it is actually better than most hotels in Myanmar. Internet speed is not fast in the whole country and may break off.||Having stayed at various locations in Yangon, I can say this hotel is very centrally located. You can walk to visit Chauk Htat Gyi and Nga Htat Gyi Pagodas and be back within 2 hours without rushing. Shwedagon is also within walking distance.Downtown and Kandawgyi Lake are also not far away.  ||The best thing about this hotel is the hot water. You get very hot water very fast, better than some 5 star hotels.||Try not to venture to the basement as it is a \""Love Tunnel\"" mostly for the local businessmen. The hotel staff is helpful, friendly and professional. Highly recommended, it is unbeatable at the price I paid. The only negative about this hotel is that there are no shops, shopping centres or amenities nearby. There is a diesel generator planted at the entrance of the hotel so any electrical outages are very short."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

It is okay to pay extra for the food, and the quality and variety should be improved immediately.\nRoom dining is expensive than quality , the selection is too small, and  can’t see any photos menu’s.\nThere is no information in the room about customer services such as in-room dining or massage and guide.\nMost of the facilities are closed for repairs or renovations.\nThere were hardly any customers.\nI plan to come again, but this place needs in-room services befitting a mid-range to high-end hotel, as well as high-speed, large-capacity, stable Wi-Fi, etc. as soon as possible.\nWith the current quality, even half the price feels too expensive."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNF0EEipwOG7PwrXKzsR6h3luvh21zbmE-4J_g\u0026fid=0x0:0x4a7afe4d832d25c9""],""When"":""2023-11-9""},{""Name"":""Briana Brown"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUDo_TtJ4d5-QI0W3pOhU8Mc7V4sKd5o3g57e5U1p9Zmlzu42Ha=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This was my first visit to Myanmar and I am so happy to have stayed at this hotel!

The best thing about the Hotel are the cheerful, friendly, helpful staff, who deserve credit. The rooms are a bit tired and decorated in a random way, as if they just used whatever was to hand. Views vary quite considerably, from decent ones into a (admittedly decrepit) garden, to boring ones over roofs and roads. Rooms smelt musty, and some had visible mould growing (in the dry season), but this is not unusual in Yangon. Design is a bit illogical - in the room I was in the TV was placed in a position where it was almost impossible to watch it! The water pressure in the shower is only just sufficient and water temperature tends to swing between scalding and freezing at random. They do not advertise laundry and minibar costs in any of the rooms, which seems to me due to either carelessness or an underhand attempt to fleece unwary customers. So, check the prices with reception before use either as they are not cheap! There is no internet provided in the rooms, which puts them behind competitors in this price range. I sense this is because they want to encourage guests to hang out at the Coffee Circles restaurant which is next door and owned by the same people I assume. The free breakfast are also served at Coffee Circles and is a monotonous two eggs, two pretty revolting and rubber little frankfurter style sausages, deep fried, a piece of polystyrene masquerading as toast and a pot of strong (but rarely) hot coffee. As someone has mentioned before, 'long-stay' guests can get Myanmar breakfast options - mohinga, ouq-nouq khao swe (noodles with chicken), and pauq-si (dumpling) with a spring roll. As the 'Western' set breakfast is so monotonous, I don't know why they don't just offer this option to all guests as standard. Even if you are not 'long stay', worth lobbying for this option, as it gets hard to eat the 'Western' breakfast after a couple of days. The wireless connection at Coffee Circles is also pretty shaky and the food is pretty uninspiring. Overall, I don't think this hotel offers good value for money. It is well-positioned and convenient, but my sense is that it is being milked as a cash cow by the owners who don't seem to be very interested in making it a good experience for guests, but rather providing the bare minimum in order to extract the maximum amount of cash out of them. To reiterate, the exception to the rule are the staff, whose genuinely friendly attitudes make the whole experience a lot better than it would otherwise be. Due to the supply/demand imbalance created by the recent influx of tourists and development workers, Yangon hotels are notoriously bad value for money. I think that the Guest Care will be able to get away with offering this very mediocre experience for a couple more years, but then with supply catching up with demand, they will start to seriously fall behind if they don't raise their game of lower their prices significantly. As it is, there are better options available for the money."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Germana B"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QdHDxxyBDO6igPA51sqxYAI1TTeuGvapT1sWSCJfPSgzOZltNlMhWmUDpj2A3v7zAw89g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""I have been living and travelling in Thailand in the last 4 years and this was my first time in Yangon for a business trip.
