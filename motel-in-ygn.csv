I should have been more cautious and read the reviews more carefully.  First, there is no elevator.  My fault for not checking that, so no negative rating for this.  The hotel has 8 floors so you may have to climb 8 stories to your room. The biggest shock factor was how old and beat up the rooms were.  The website pictures look nice but are either photoshopped or so old that they no longer are accurate.  The walls are dirty and covered in the blood of many dead mosquitoes.  The bathrooms used to have white grout, but now are black with mildew.  -2 rating for horribly accurate pictures.  Second, the hotel does nothing for mosquito control.  I stayed in multiple hotels throughout Myanmar and every hotel was proactive at controlling the mosquitoes.  This place does nothing and the rooms were filled with them.  We got bit multiple times during the night.  -1 rating for mosquito control.  We got the entire floor (two rooms), and one of the rooms smelled of cigarette smoke.  -1 rating for that.  +1 rating as the staff seemed nice, the breakfast was decent, and location was good.

The first hotel I booked at $20 per night was an absolute dive. I got out of there as quickly as I could! Walked into Hotel Bond having checked it out online, yes it was a higher price, but worth every penny. The staff were so welcoming when I turned up at 8 in the morning, got me settled into a room and even invited me to have breakfast. The staff carried my suitcase up the stairs and even with the shared bathroom, i never saw the other guest sharing the bathroom so there was no conflict there. The bathroom was excellent with a rainforest shower and a smaller shower head. My suggestions here would be to get some bigger shampoo and shower gel bottles, the tiny individual ones are a waste of plastic and in this case space given that it is a shared bathroom. Putting some floor mats for the bathroom would also be a good idea, 2-3 so each room can have their own.||The room was small but very comfortable and clean.||The breakfast was decent and the daily noodle dish was always vegetable only which is just perfect!||My only other recommendation would be large water refills. Whilst having large water bottles as well as small is a big step above most hotels, I would prefer to use no plastic at all. When I asked the guy at the desk where I might refill my bottle, he said he didn't know and to maybe try a pagoda, when I walked out the door it was less than 30 seconds before I saw that there are water tanks on the street all over the place and these are for anyone to use! Hurrah! Still it would be great if the hotel included water refills in their breakfast room."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

My stay now was from 4 to 14 December 2017. The reason I selected this hotel was on the first place because of the interesting location (at least for me). Yangon is gradually becoming a hellhole of traffic jams. However, taxis starting at M.G.M. hotel find easily their way as well to Pyay Road and the airport as to the city center. At the same time, the hotel is near to a number of green lanes where  one can still observe authentic Burmese daily life. As for the hotel itself, it's a place where you can feel at ease. The staff is friendly, polite and helpful. I knew from my previous stay that I should avoid sleeping in a room above the Karaoke bar on the second floor. I slept on the 8th floor, where at night it was quiet except for the barking of swerving groups of dogs. These dogs are very peaceful during the day but seemingly become aggressive when they form kind of gangs during the night. Breakfast at M.G.M. hotel is good and abundant. However, if you like the rice, noodles, vegetables, eggs, etc...  warm, rather enjoy them at 7 AM and not at 9 AM.  On the first floor there's a good Chinese restaurant, and around the hotel restaurants of all categories and prices abound. Just next door is the Japanese restaurant Doreen. There's foot massage available  just at the right side of the hotel and also at other places at walking distance. Walking briskly you can reach Scott Market and Sule Pagoda in the city center in less than half an hour. Guided by a Licensed Tour Guide (Than Than Htwe@Hannah), I needed more time, but I learned a lot about the history and heritage value of buildings in Chinatown and the Indian quarter. While working in my hotel room, I experienced that WIFI quality had much improved since 2015, but sometimes download speed was still too low."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

We stayed for 14 days, before and after our up-country road trip.  The rooms were big, bright and very clean with crispy white bed linen.  The king size bed was nice and comfortable.  Room 601, being the corner room, had views from both sides of the windows.  The hotel staff were very accommodating especially Hla Myo Thwe (reservations) and Ko Nay (male receptionist).  The doorman always opened the car door for us whenever we stepped in and out of a taxi, and would always help to carry our bags.  The hotel is situated conveniently in the Ahlone suburb and is a walking distance to places to eat.  There is a 24/7 convenience store across the main road at the corner of Forest Road where you can buy coke, milk and lots of snacks; and a telephone shop down Forest Road where you can get Burmese telephone SIM cards with unlimited internet data (very cheap).   The air conditioner in both the rooms are very powerful.  When you check-in, Reception gives you a code(s) for your smartphone/laptop devices, and depending on how many devices you have, you can ask for extra codes without any hassle.  The receptionist girls were extremely helpful in helping us with getting \""Grab\"" taxis and helping us download the \""Grab\"" App on our iPhones.  Grab taxis are like Uber taxis, safe, convenient and generally cheaper than normal taxis in Yangon.  The only negative things if I have to mention would be (1) the elevator is extremely slow and you have to wait for some time.  (2)  Breakfast caters more Asian food; western food is very limited.  Fried rice, fried noodles/vermicelli is served everyday and is boring when you are staying for more than 3-4 days.  (3)  In the bathroom there is no shower screen or divider/partition to stop the water from splashing and wetting the entire area.  This is a dangerous hazard as one can very easily have a bad fall from the wet and slippery bathroom floor.  Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely return to stay at Hotel 99 on our next Burma trip.

Rooms were good, clean and well equipped. Breakfast was great, with omelettes cooked to order as well as the usual buffet fare. We travelled rounf Myanmar and returned to this hotel 2 weeks later to the same standard of service. Can't comment on the nearby ameneties, or the area in general as we were merely 'passing through' and needed a bed for the night. Overall, a good hotel with everything you need for a short stay. Probably not best location if you want a week here, but for us it was ideal.

So in an apples-to-apples comparison, it is close to 3 stars. . .  but falls short in several ways. You be the judge:||The room was large and wasnt lacking for furniture, but the drapes were badly torn and the bedding had a lot of visible stains.  ||The plush headboard was likewise filthy and the pillows were very well used.||Moving on to the bathroom, the shower had plenty of hot water but 75% flowed out if the downspout, leaving the shower with rather weak pressure. The shower head was mounted below chest level. I brought these issues up with the staff on day 1, but there was no change during our time there.||Finally, the free breakfast. It was next door in a busy restaurant. There is a choice of 4 set menus with no changes allowed (it is not a buffet). Most hotels (every one we have stayed at in Yangon) have a buffet. The restaurant wouldn't even give us water, only tea or coffee (which I doubt is from filtered water). The water at the hotel is turbid (a light brown color), and I imagine that is what you get with the tea/coffee.||We brought our own bottled every morning which was not a problem.||I would give details about the number of flies in the restaurant, but suffice it to say that if you dont like flies buzzing everywhere, you might want to avoid the place.||The location (walking distance to the lake) was ok.

The room condition was ok for this discounted price. But less than 30  minutes after check-in, I found out that the hotel is renovating the 2nd and 3rd floor. Wall crushing hammering and drilling noise was as loud as they are working around my room. It not different from staying in the middle of construction site.  I went down to reception, she said they will noisy during workday 10AM to 5PM (but on Saturday, when I check-out, they were still continuing the hammering). I asked reception, if there any available room on the higher floor. She said no. So, I send email to the booking app's customer service right away with video clip to show them how crazy was the construction noise. (See the uploaded clip) Agoda never contact back. Next day I have to contact agoda again, they responded and said that they did not receive my first email. I send them more video clips, then they managed the hotel to move me to 6th floor.   Agoda do not provide direct complain channel, but ask me to complain via themselves, the customer service.\n\nNew room on 6th is quite quiet from the construction noise on lower floors BUT the room was full of strong smoking odour. My cloth was smell like the room when I unpacked my luggage at home.  The shower curtain was horribly mouldy. In the second night, there was a young local couple trying to get into my room with the correct key card. They can unlock electronically but stuck with manual lock from the inside. I am not sure who else got into my room when I was away. There were safebox but without manual. The walkway on 6th floor was so dark with red lanterns hanging along the corridor. There were lot of activities by their local guests in the late night on 6th floor. Which imply that they might provide hour rent for local kingky visit during the night.\n\nLater I provided negative feedback for Agoda as they requested via email. They gave USD3.60 back to my agoda account. I feel like being slapped with USD 3.60. My short trip was impacted from the time I spent on this problem for 2 rounds, then I have to spend 2nd night in the tobacco odour room.\n\nCleanliness, I would give 0/5. The pillow on 4th floor still have odour from previous sweaty guest. The blanket and pillow covers does not look like freshly washed. The shower curtains on 6th floor were mouldy.\n\nLocation I would rate 4/5 but at the moment the government put barbwire and barricade on the road around the city hall at the south end of the one-way 33th street, where the hotel located.  All of taxi and grab ride denied getting into this road, so I had to walk to/from main road for taxi and grab.\n\nI did not expect anything luxury room form this cheap rent at all but the common-sense of the hotel were absence: 1. They just crushing the building wall without considering that their guests might spend some hours during daytime in the room away from Yangon heat. Even they want to crush the 3rd floor, they can avoid accepting any booking into 4th floor during construction period. 2. It is OK for the hotel to have room for smoking guests but must not book non-smoking guest into that room. 3. After typing no.2. I just suspicious about smoke detector in the room. Should I expect fire safety from cheap hotel when I have to stay on the 6th floor with permanently locked iron grill on the window?\n\nI told Agoda that the customers need to be informed about the noisy condition. After that on agoda, I see the hotel still discounting without informing about noisy condition."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPuEx4JM1pu0g4dsnDsaGBLwHlSKqaKTUz0v-LL\u0026fid=0x0:0x8270cede795c888a""],""When"":""2022-10-17""},{""Name"":""Pyae Pyae Aung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6oqumeMsDq8FuzZH7k_YeBeA5Q5Q8jfcCNQ9VMCeCUzdNNBnB=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I never used to write bad comment.

While the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, there were some aspects of the stay that left me with mixed feelings.\n\nOne commendable aspect was the staff's effort in acquainting us with the current restrictions in Yangon, which was much appreciated. Additionally, the hotel's location was a highlight, conveniently close to the colonial building point and only a short 10-minute walk away.\n\nHowever, there were several recommendations I would like to make for the management and future guests:\n\n1. Room Type Discrepancy: Despite booking a double room, I was informed upon arrival that this room type was not available. As a result, I had to pay for an extra bed, which was disappointing and inconvenient.\n\n2. Breakfast : The breakfast provided was quite basic, consisting of only 1 coffee, 2 toasts, and 1 egg. It did not meet my expectations for a satisfying morning meal.\n\n3. Room Condition: The private room I stayed in could use some improvement. The roller blinds were old and torn, the room had a musty smell, and the shower in the private bathroom was disappointingly weak, leading me to opt for the shared bathroom instead.\n\n4. Stairs and Elevators: It's worth noting that most small or medium-sized hotels/hostels in Myanmar have high/steep stairs and no elevators. Guests should be aware of this when making their reservations to avoid any surprises.\n\nDespite these concerns, the highlight of the stay was undoubtedly the exceptional staff.

The hotel looks like a 3 star hotel and we had some doubts when we went into the hotel lounge.

The bar is literally two simple tables with different alcohol bottles displayed on it. We didn't have much hope. But the view was great and we had a good view of the padoga and full moon, which was really nice. Ordered a mojito and it was not bad at all. In other countries, this will probably get two or three stars from me but given that it is in myanmar, I think the place deserves 4 stars. Just remember that this is still a relatively new emerging market and places are still not fully commercialize yet, which is the main point. Sit back, enjoy the view, sip the cocktail which is only usd2.5, and relax. I'm sure one day, this bar will go through dramatic transformation into a high end bar with proper chairs, deco and expensive cocktails but I truly like it the way it is now.

The place isn't really glitzy but it has a definite charm, perhaps as a recognition of quieter times in Yangon.  It is a must visit in Yangon.

In nearly 3 weeks in myanmar we stayed in various places, all of which we found great, even very cheap backpackers hostels with no warm water or mirror in the room. However, we do think you should get what you pay for and this place just doesn't make sense. ||positive things first: the hotel is well located, near some nice restaurants and cafes and not far from the shwedagon pagoda. And the wifi works well. ||Other than that, it really sucked. Was by far and away the worst hotel we stayed in, in an almost 3 week trip to Myanmar - and the most expensive!! (Slightly surpassing even a beach front bungalow at Ngapali!)||The hotel and its furniture and equipment are very very old with some ridiculous features, like none of the room or bathroom lights working unless the main light is on (which makes it hard when one person is awake and the other isn't), and an almost cute built- in radio set from the 70s at the very latest! ||bad smell in the room (of smoking, to which a bellboy was sent to spray some anti-odor all over the room...) and in the hallways (of ginger cooking or something like that) - both topped with a lingering scent of mold. Bath was uninviting to say the least. ||My friend came in late and accidentally  walked into a different room to discover that the key worked!! After which she tried a few more and apparently the magic key opened all the rooms she tried. Didn't really matter because the hotel was empty except for us - and rightfully so.||The reason we picked this hotel was because of the so-called rooftop bar, which turned out to be a poor guy standing in front of a small reception table stocked with some alcohol bottles,  and an entirely unimpressive view. Yes, you can see the Shwedagon pagoda but aside from that not much more. ||We know there is a supply-demand problem in Yangon which makes for a situation in which hotels don't need to try very hard and still have a steady flow of clients.

Chose this hotel primarily for the location to wander in and around the characterful backstreets that fill out the spaces between Chinatown and the Colonial waterfront. The location didn't disappoint, neither did the hotel experience, although I should say that given the choice I'm someone who prefers functional to over-embellished rooms; the rooftop restaurant for breakfasts at sunrise and a drink near sundown were well worth the compact rooms. Staff were helpful and responsive, so definitely not a bad place to stay.  If you're looking to spend more time in your room rather than venturing out and exploring then it might not be the place for you.

I didn't want to lose any precious sleep to take a taxi for nearly an hour drive from downtown at the crack of dawn.  Sky Hotel wasn't yet on Trip Advisor yet I found it on google maps.  ||It is a gem in the middle of a pretty rough and downtrodden area of outskirts Yangon.  ||The staff is so helpful.  The facility perfect for a one night stay.  There is nothing of interest outside of the hotel property so thankfully the restaurant was quite good.  I had dinner delivered by room service and was quite satisfied.  The room was equipped with all my needs and was very clean, hot water and nice enough.||I may suggest that you request a room at the backside because the road in front of the hotel is quite noisy from the traffic.||||The staff encouraged me to partake in the breakfast buffet even though i thought i wouldn't have time.  But everything timed perfectly.  The buffet was ample, delicious and filling.  There is even a espresso/latte machine where you can make your own drinks.

As most of the reviews have already mentioned,  choose the rooms towards the back of the hotel (away from the road) and preferably to the right (facing east), these rooms have a better view and also you will get a glimpse of the rising sun. The hotel's buffet breakfast is great and each day they have a special local cuisine. This, in my opinion, would be a very safe way to try out the local dishes. The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained. The only problem is  that the doors do not appear to be sound proof and could be a problem if there are a lot of guests moving in-and-out of their rooms. TIP: There is a City Mart outlet straight down the road, about 15mins walk. There is a hospital nearby. There are some great food places in about 15mins walk.  (Note: photos are from the Junior Suite B room #403)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNTRys335Gz8GYnI6YYBqGeugAo2Gk_wDNJK7Uv\u0026fid=0x0:0x2c8d2472717556e6""],""When"":""2018-1-7""},{""Name"":""Sandy’s Shine"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXd9XwYaXMx0VXxehGbmy_BXGG7o4D1R7qOLglJAXom2nLJ9IM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best technology in the leather industry"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ian Borja"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUNLX_Fs9Bq4tJkkoiCk_V6a2wYuYVowqo_cuP2tYcQNCXRug1DBw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Small hotel of about 20 rooms.

When I took the taxis from downtown a few time, those drivers take some time to check the location."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Steven Coyle"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL5XHl8TtKzOd7gmgi2MyZXHwNJusJINmj_xNrm712hExHBBg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Don’t know y this place is getting whacked.

Much better than where I Iive in Malaysia.\n\nStaff punch the lift without me asking them to do it.\n\nAnother overhead me speaking to myself wondering if there was an English newspaper on the magazine rack (there wasn’t) then running to another table to find one before I got into the lift (again without me asking for this).

It's a beautiful hotel. Enjoyed my stay here, but a few things didn't add up. Like the fitness center, the food and the wifi. Before I booked the hotel, on the booking site it says fitness center available, but unfortunately when I got to the hotel that was something I never saw. And then the food wasn't that good. Like they got limited varieties of food and most are cooked with too much oil which wasn't really good. The wifi was really TERRIBLE, one of the reasons why I had to change hotel. I also noticed like most taxi drivers in the city |Always have trouble locating the hotel, like in 3 different occasions the cabbies had to call the hotel for direction or some even got lost completely trying to find the hotel.|But other than this few setbacks at the hotel, I love the cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms are big and the staffs are super friendly and nice. Would definitely stay here again when next time I'm in Yangon."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""may (Deena)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWw16bij02lzmdoh_BexSoLh12kH-wqPj79ll1IVCoWFzNlC_yV=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""2nd floor has body massage for 1.5hr 25000."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Thant Z"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QeCck1CfANpZm9bBk3PHtP97Kh9k25HZfvq9yAWlN3BaIyjSHUPEfWkhAJmuYiJsH-_6g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""New hotel with clean and room is spacious enough.
