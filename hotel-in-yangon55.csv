It’s basic, but the taste was superb. WiFi is really good for Myanmar, you could even watch Netflix!|I saw some double rooms and they are nice, with balcony and space. I slept in a single and that is below par. It is clean and with toilet, warm water, fridge, airco but without a window, just one TL lamp. But the one star lost is because of the noice. I heard everyone and everything indoors during the night. From 6am on, even ear plugs give up. They ask a bit too much for this room (14)||This is a great spot, but avoid the cheapest rooms."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Urdax Ugarte"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVtTWGxKgXqGKQtqf7yJosymj1yhnBNenG9Gn3_GpvrOJS3IFyA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We were lucky to get the front room that comes with AC and big windows overlooking the quiet street.

We are used to living rough - we stayed at a couple local villages with no indoor plumbing, minimal electricity, and felt the accommodations were much nicer than at Shwe War.||We would give the staff a sold 4/5 stars, but the facilities and experience were a generous 2/5. ||The Good||We loved the staff! Everyone was lovely, attentive, flexible and kind. We were greeted warmly and with smiles every time we arrived or departed the hotel. They were quick to accommodate all of our needs and allowed a late check out at no extra cost. |||The Bad||Breakfast was pretty terrible. I guess we shouldn’t have ordered the more western breakfast and instead opted for local fare, which may have made a huge difference. White bread egg sandwich with velveta style American cheese that had cucumber and...ketchup?||The room was roomy and had most everything we needed, but the bed was rock hard and we found ants on our comforter after arriving. We were told that we had probably left something on the bed and that’s why ants had arrived. But whatever the case, this was a massive turn-off and left us feeling very uneasy about sleeping in the room. To their credit, they had a group of staff members to our room within minutes of making the phone call to complain and changed the linens and sprayed ant spray around the floor. We suggested a new room but they said ours was the best room.||The carpet also left a lot to be desired. It had lots of stains from glitter, glue(?), and dead bugs embedded into the fabric. The bathroom was awful as well. Shower hardware was broken so I had to squat to rinse my head and hold the shower for my wife who has an injured shoulder. There was also mold on the bathroom walls, sticky gunk on the mirror, and the sink drain barely worked. |||"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""OeivindSlaatto"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QfCm-MBS7Itwd4h-55xcyygsVKq1IZbUTNyg17UKkQsT2C3oSXBlQ_-pGTl8imnrFVtVw=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""I stayed here with my partner for 11 days while working in Yangon.

Tea, toasts with butter and/or jam and pineapple.\n\nRegarding cleaning. It's OK but don't expect a super clean place with staff dedicated all day.\n\nWe paid 17$ for a night. Compared to other hostels in the same location this hostel is doesn't worth more than 12$.\n\nOverrated, overpriced, overnoisy, oversmoky."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

First, let us start with the price, for less than US$150 for 4 days and 3 nights it is definitely a winner. Plus lots of freebies in the room like water, coffee, tea etc. The reception is very accommodating and Ted was very helpful in booking our Grab wherever we go. He always makes it a point that the driver knows where to take us and even talks to the driver just to be sure. Our room is always kept clean, tidy with clean sheets. Our friends who visited us were surprised with how affordable and yet our room is big enough, comfortable and safe.  We definitely recommended Golden Guest Inn to our friends who are visiting Yangon and will continue to recommend them because its like our second home away from the Philippines.

Also still have hair on the floor for a newly clean room.\n\nBreakfast/ 3 Stars - normal, not much choice.\n\nBellman - leaked of concentration.

The first hotel I booked at $20 per night was an absolute dive. I got out of there as quickly as I could! Walked into Hotel Bond having checked it out online, yes it was a higher price, but worth every penny. The staff were so welcoming when I turned up at 8 in the morning, got me settled into a room and even invited me to have breakfast. The staff carried my suitcase up the stairs and even with the shared bathroom, i never saw the other guest sharing the bathroom so there was no conflict there. The bathroom was excellent with a rainforest shower and a smaller shower head. My suggestions here would be to get some bigger shampoo and shower gel bottles, the tiny individual ones are a waste of plastic and in this case space given that it is a shared bathroom. Putting some floor mats for the bathroom would also be a good idea, 2-3 so each room can have their own.||The room was small but very comfortable and clean.||The breakfast was decent and the daily noodle dish was always vegetable only which is just perfect!||My only other recommendation would be large water refills. Whilst having large water bottles as well as small is a big step above most hotels, I would prefer to use no plastic at all. When I asked the guy at the desk where I might refill my bottle, he said he didn't know and to maybe try a pagoda, when I walked out the door it was less than 30 seconds before I saw that there are water tanks on the street all over the place and these are for anyone to use!

My stay now was from 4 to 14 December 2017. The reason I selected this hotel was on the first place because of the interesting location (at least for me). Yangon is gradually becoming a hellhole of traffic jams. However, taxis starting at M.G.M. hotel find easily their way as well to Pyay Road and the airport as to the city center. At the same time, the hotel is near to a number of green lanes where  one can still observe authentic Burmese daily life. As for the hotel itself, it's a place where you can feel at ease. The staff is friendly, polite and helpful. I knew from my previous stay that I should avoid sleeping in a room above the Karaoke bar on the second floor. I slept on the 8th floor, where at night it was quiet except for the barking of swerving groups of dogs. These dogs are very peaceful during the day but seemingly become aggressive when they form kind of gangs during the night. Breakfast at M.G.M. hotel is good and abundant. However, if you like the rice, noodles, vegetables, eggs, etc...  warm, rather enjoy them at 7 AM and not at 9 AM.  On the first floor there's a good Chinese restaurant, and around the hotel restaurants of all categories and prices abound. Just next door is the Japanese restaurant Doreen. There's foot massage available  just at the right side of the hotel and also at other places at walking distance. Walking briskly you can reach Scott Market and Sule Pagoda in the city center in less than half an hour. Guided by a Licensed Tour Guide (Than Than Htwe@Hannah), I needed more time, but I learned a lot about the history and heritage value of buildings in Chinatown and the Indian quarter. While working in my hotel room, I experienced that WIFI quality had much improved since 2015, but sometimes download speed was still too low."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

While the hotel boasted some commendable aspects, there were also notable areas that fell short of expectations.\n\nUpon arrival, I was greeted by a courteous receptionist who efficiently checked me in. The lobby exuded a sophisticated ambiance with its modern decor and comfortable seating areas. However, the check-in process felt slightly disorganized, with a longer wait time than anticipated.\n\nEntering my room, I was initially impressed by its cleanliness and spacious layout. The bed was comfortable, and the linens appeared fresh. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed some signs of wear and tear, such as scuff marks on the furniture and a few stains on the carpet. Additionally, the room lacked certain amenities that are becoming standard in many hotels, such as a coffee maker and mini-fridge.\n\nThe bathroom, while adequately sized, had outdated fixtures and could benefit from a renovation. The water pressure in the shower was inconsistent, alternating between strong bursts and weak dribbles. Furthermore, the toiletries provided were of subpar quality, failing to meet the standard expected from a hotel of this caliber.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's dining options. The breakfast buffet offered a variety of delicious dishes, ranging from traditional favorites to international selections. The restaurant staff were attentive and accommodating, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. However, the prices were on the higher side, and I felt that the value for money could have been better.\n\nThe hotel's amenities left much to be desired. While there was a fitness center available, it was small and poorly equipped. Additionally, the pool area was underwhelming, with limited seating and a lack of ambiance. It seemed as though these facilities were an afterthought rather than a focal point of the hotel's offerings.\n\nIn terms of location, the Riverview Hotel was conveniently situated near several attractions and transportation options. However, the surrounding area was noisy, especially at night, which detracted from the overall tranquility of the stay. Furthermore, parking was limited and expensive, adding an extra inconvenience for guests with vehicles.\n\nOn the service front, the staff were generally friendly and helpful, although there were instances where communication was lacking. For example, requests made to the front desk were sometimes forgotten or took longer than expected to fulfill. Additionally, housekeeping could be inconsistent, with some days seeing thorough cleanings while others left much to be desired.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Riverview Hotel was a mixed bag. While there were aspects to appreciate, such as the dining options and cleanliness of the rooms, there were also notable shortcomings, including outdated facilities and inconsistent service. With some improvements in these areas, the hotel has the potential to elevate its rating and provide a more satisfying experience for guests."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ko Kyaw"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXk3SOvIliN7feYgaUVVkur6fMkjVbC2q0sbZDoKcRXWKV7QYwoCw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Very well decorated.

We understand that early check-in is subject to availability, but this was disappointing. We checked in at 2 p.m. as directed.\n\nDuring the check-in process, the reception team did not thoroughly verify our booking details. They requested full payment upfront despite our prior payment of half the charges via Kpay. We had to remind them to recheck the information, which was frustrating and could have easily been avoided with better attention to detail.\n\nSecondly, our room was not ready upon arrival, even though we had informed the reception in advance of our arrival time. When escorted to the room, the staff knocked before entering, which raised concerns about whether they were unsure if the room was properly assigned to us. Additionally, the key card provided didn’t work, leaving us waiting outside for an extended period. The staff eventually opened the room with a master key but left us with the malfunctioning card instead of replacing it with a functional one. This was not only inconvenient but also unprofessional.\n\nThe state of the room itself was also disappointing. The bed was not properly organized, and the decorative pillows and blanket shown in your promotional photos were haphazardly stored in the wardrobe rather than being arranged on the bed. This lack of attention to detail made us question whether the room had been properly cleaned after the last guest’s stay. The staff member assisting us also did not offer any information about the facilities, and their tone and demeanor were far from what one would expect from hospitality staff. We felt disrespected and unwelcome.\n\nLastly, communication between staff was noticeably poor. Upon leaving for dinner, we informed the reception about the faulty key card and handed it over for replacement. However, when we returned, the staff on duty seemed unaware of the situation and even questioned whether we had handed in the key at all. This clear lack of communication between shifts added to our dissatisfaction.\n\nOverall,  the service we received was far from the standard we anticipated, and we hope these issues will be addressed for future guests."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Pearl Su"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKmPkagE-Z23PA_7GpkkzZQ94VuUT3WYlPp5b7EJRlt0Efunw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""It is located inside of the alley.

The room condition was ok for this discounted price. But less than 30  minutes after check-in, I found out that the hotel is renovating the 2nd and 3rd floor. Wall crushing hammering and drilling noise was as loud as they are working around my room. It not different from staying in the middle of construction site.  I went down to reception, she said they will noisy during workday 10AM to 5PM (but on Saturday, when I check-out, they were still continuing the hammering). I asked reception, if there any available room on the higher floor. She said no. So, I send email to the booking app's customer service right away with video clip to show them how crazy was the construction noise. (See the uploaded clip) Agoda never contact back. Next day I have to contact agoda again, they responded and said that they did not receive my first email. I send them more video clips, then they managed the hotel to move me to 6th floor.   Agoda do not provide direct complain channel, but ask me to complain via themselves, the customer service.\n\nNew room on 6th is quite quiet from the construction noise on lower floors BUT the room was full of strong smoking odour. My cloth was smell like the room when I unpacked my luggage at home.  The shower curtain was horribly mouldy. In the second night, there was a young local couple trying to get into my room with the correct key card. They can unlock electronically but stuck with manual lock from the inside. I am not sure who else got into my room when I was away. There were safebox but without manual. The walkway on 6th floor was so dark with red lanterns hanging along the corridor. There were lot of activities by their local guests in the late night on 6th floor. Which imply that they might provide hour rent for local kingky visit during the night.\n\nLater I provided negative feedback for Agoda as they requested via email. They gave USD3.60 back to my agoda account. I feel like being slapped with USD 3.60. My short trip was impacted from the time I spent on this problem for 2 rounds, then I have to spend 2nd night in the tobacco odour room.\n\nCleanliness, I would give 0/5. The pillow on 4th floor still have odour from previous sweaty guest. The blanket and pillow covers does not look like freshly washed. The shower curtains on 6th floor were mouldy.\n\nLocation I would rate 4/5 but at the moment the government put barbwire and barricade on the road around the city hall at the south end of the one-way 33th street, where the hotel located.  All of taxi and grab ride denied getting into this road, so I had to walk to/from main road for taxi and grab.\n\nI did not expect anything luxury room form this cheap rent at all but the common-sense of the hotel were absence: 1. They just crushing the building wall without considering that their guests might spend some hours during daytime in the room away from Yangon heat. Even they want to crush the 3rd floor, they can avoid accepting any booking into 4th floor during construction period. 2. It is OK for the hotel to have room for smoking guests but must not book non-smoking guest into that room. 3. After typing no.2. I just suspicious about smoke detector in the room. Should I expect fire safety from cheap hotel when I have to stay on the 6th floor with permanently locked iron grill on the window?\n\nI told Agoda that the customers need to be informed about the noisy condition. After that on agoda, I see the hotel still discounting without informing about noisy condition."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPuEx4JM1pu0g4dsnDsaGBLwHlSKqaKTUz0v-LL\u0026fid=0x0:0x8270cede795c888a""],""When"":""2022-10-17""},{""Name"":""Pyae Pyae Aung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6oqumeMsDq8FuzZH7k_YeBeA5Q5Q8jfcCNQ9VMCeCUzdNNBnB=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I never used to write bad comment.

We checked-in around 3PM. Says you can check-in starting at 2PM. But when we arrived, the room wasn't quite ready yet. They were still fixing the water heater. They informed us that we'll be able to use hot water by night-time. The Side Table and Stools weren't even arranged properly when we arrived. We specifically requested the lake view room but was allocated at the 5th floor where the lake can't be seen as it's covered by trees. Still we get the view of Shwedagon Pagoda though. The room was hot, humid and a bit dusty when we checked in. Bed sheets are stained in some places but we didn't complain. What I was disgusted most by is the mold in Shower Curtains. Yuck! And hair remains in the bathtub and floor near the bed. At night, I turned on hot water and all I got was air, rusted brown water and cold water. I called them to check and they came in claiming the water is usable and is warm. It wasn't. Don't let me start with the room key card... Works 1 out of 30 tries. They came to change batteries both in the evening and the next morning. Every time we get out of the room we get locked out even though we have the key card with us. The only good thing was the tasty breakfast with a wide variety to choose from. Even for breakfast, the dining room arrangement sucked. They put two extra tables and chairs close to the buffet table and we have to tuck through these to get the food. Ugh... And they rang the doorbell at 7 AM mistakenly with the next room who were to check-out that morning. Didn't even say they were sorry for the interruption. We were given breakfast tickets but when we arrived at the dining room, no one was there to collect it so we left these tickets on the table after we were done eating. Guess what? They called us at 9AM and said it was the last call for breakfast. Good that they remind us for Breakfast, bad that they suck at who has finished eating and who have not. Overall, it seems overrated and overpriced compared to other hotels in town. Maybe they treat us locals differently from foreigners, not sure about that, as the room rates for locals and foreigners are different.

We stayed for 14 days, before and after our up-country road trip.  The rooms were big, bright and very clean with crispy white bed linen.  The king size bed was nice and comfortable.  Room 601, being the corner room, had views from both sides of the windows.  The hotel staff were very accommodating especially Hla Myo Thwe (reservations) and Ko Nay (male receptionist).  The doorman always opened the car door for us whenever we stepped in and out of a taxi, and would always help to carry our bags.  The hotel is situated conveniently in the Ahlone suburb and is a walking distance to places to eat.  There is a 24/7 convenience store across the main road at the corner of Forest Road where you can buy coke, milk and lots of snacks; and a telephone shop down Forest Road where you can get Burmese telephone SIM cards with unlimited internet data (very cheap).   The air conditioner in both the rooms are very powerful.  When you check-in, Reception gives you a code(s) for your smartphone/laptop devices, and depending on how many devices you have, you can ask for extra codes without any hassle.  The receptionist girls were extremely helpful in helping us with getting \""Grab\"" taxis and helping us download the \""Grab\"" App on our iPhones.  Grab taxis are like Uber taxis, safe, convenient and generally cheaper than normal taxis in Yangon.  The only negative things if I have to mention would be (1) the elevator is extremely slow and you have to wait for some time.  (2)  Breakfast caters more Asian food; western food is very limited.  Fried rice, fried noodles/vermicelli is served everyday and is boring when you are staying for more than 3-4 days.  (3)  In the bathroom there is no shower screen or divider/partition to stop the water from splashing and wetting the entire area.  This is a dangerous hazard as one can very easily have a bad fall from the wet and slippery bathroom floor.  Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely return to stay at Hotel 99 on our next Burma trip.

The amenities feel like it is at least 3.5 star, but this hotel is actually just a 2 star.\n\nElectricity is always on 24/7 and the internet is pretty decent. I had zoom calls without much lag!\n\nOne downside though is every service here is EXPENSIVE. Laundry, food, breakfast are all above average priced. The only saving grace is that they give you free airport transfers. But I guess that is their business model, cheap brief layover stays.\n\nAlso, they tried to keep my passport safe for me in a folder. I didn't appreciate that at all, they should have brought me my passport back as soon as they didn't need it! I had to ask for it back...\n\nFinally, the location (aside from being close to the airport) is horrible. Only 2 restaurants are nearby and they are both average at best, with one being better because if pricing. No convinient stores at all, you can't buy snacks or any thing else you need like shampoo without taking a taxi to the middle of the city.\n\nOverall it was a good stay, I would comeback again a day before my next flight out of Myanmar.

Faint KTV music can be heard through room insulation on weekend nights.

There was also no construction when I was there. My room is huge (and ceiling high), the television is so far away (8-10m) from my bed I have problem seeing the details. In contrast my hotel room in the city centre was so small that the TV is mounted like 80cm from the bed and they have to put it near the ceiling to increase the distance. The rooms are very well furnished (best value for money IMHO) and bigger than the family room that I had booked at the nearby Crystal Palace Hotel. It is a modern hotel with card entry. If you stay at the hotel you get a 20% discount at the Spa and the ONLY treatment I would recommend is the traditional massage at 10,000 kyat before discount. The Monalisa Restaurant (Level 1) is actually excellent and reasonably priced that I ended having dinner there every night. The breakfast is not excellent but quite good. There is actually an omelette counter so you can have you eggs done in any way but I did not see any eggs swimming in grease.||While the Wifi is not great, the signal is relatively strong and it is actually better than most hotels in Myanmar. Internet speed is not fast in the whole country and may break off.||Having stayed at various locations in Yangon, I can say this hotel is very centrally located. You can walk to visit Chauk Htat Gyi and Nga Htat Gyi Pagodas and be back within 2 hours without rushing. Shwedagon is also within walking distance.Downtown and Kandawgyi Lake are also not far away.  ||The best thing about this hotel is the hot water. You get very hot water very fast, better than some 5 star hotels.||Try not to venture to the basement as it is a \""Love Tunnel\"" mostly for the local businessmen. The hotel staff is helpful, friendly and professional. Highly recommended, it is unbeatable at the price I paid. The only negative about this hotel is that there are no shops, shopping centres or amenities nearby. There is a diesel generator planted at the entrance of the hotel so any electrical outages are very short."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

I wouldn't stay here unless I had to. ||||Pros: ||||A/C is cold and the mini fridge in the room is ideal for keeping snack sand water cold.  Staff have a small understanding of english and laundry service is cheap, fast and good. Close to airport.||||Cons: ||||The rooms leave a lot to be desired.  No real cleaning is done outside of making the bed, changing the sheets, emptying trash and refreshing the towels.  Vacuuming has to be requested.  Ceilings and ledges have an array of dead bugs caught in cobwebs and a layer of dirt and dead insect bodies.  Dusting doesn't happen and when housekeeping cleans your room, they leave the door open so all the mosquitoes and flying insects in the hallway come into your room.  Poor sound insulation and the floor attendants are always speaking to each other down the hallway and the hallway phone rings at all hours of the night.  Smoking is allowed in the rooms and because the walls are paper thin, if your neighbor is smoking, you may as well be in the room with him. ||||The restaurant has a breakfast buffet that caters to the Myanmar pallet. Other than the addition of eggs, the menu has no accommodation for western tastes. Mainly vegetables and starches along with some sort of native fish/pork/chicken dish.  Orange  or pink colored flavored water is the juice offered in the morning along with coffee and tea from instant add water packages. Lunch/Dinner is ordered from a Chinese Style or Thai Style Menu.  One thing can be said for sure, you could order the same dish every night for a week and you would get 7 different dishes.  While Chicken seems to be the main protein offered, it's either under-cooked, overcooked or chopped into small pieces to ensure its cooked.  Simple fried chicken wings are 2 whole wings per order, cut into 12 pcs.||||Internet connection is random and sometimes non existent.  Once you do get connected, don't expect to do more than texting because the connection can't handle the data.||||Overall:||You get what you pay for.  Does not cater to Western pallets.

Hotel is short ride from the airport. It was an ideal location as was visiting people nearby and outside of the city so depends on what your schedule is. If you want to be in the inner city then you may want an inner city hotel instead. Although I visited the inner city a few times - however the traffic in Yangon with all the roadworks at the moment and new cars coming into the market and an increase in urbanisation means you need to plan carefully your daily schedule. So be prepared for traffic jams regardless of where you stay. The hotel was reasonably clean and tidy with a good restaurant for breakfast and a tasty dinner menu. Probably overstaffed but this meant great service from a friendly staff from the front desk to porters to room service to the restaurant.

However, upon arrival, I was given a smoking room with a strong odor and a quilt cover stained with bright yellow urine marks. To make matters worse, the bathroom amenities were only set up for one person. When I requested additional items, the staff insisted that my booking was for a single guest. I had to show them proof from both my booking confirmation and the Trip.com request form before they only gave one additional toothbrush.Regarding non-smoking room, I again raised my concerns in the mid-afternoon, the receptionist informed me at around 8:30 PM that they could move me to another non-smoking room which I kindly declined because I dont have time to pack again as I am have other business meetings in that evening. Due to the overwhelming smoke smell and the unacceptable hygiene condition of the bedsheets, I was unable to sleep all night.As for the morning breakfast, I was once again disappointed by the poor service. I ordered an egg, but it was poorly prepared—its appearance was unappetising, almost resembling vomit. To make matters worse, when the restaurant staff brought it over, liquid from the eggs was dripping through their hands and onto the floor. It was extremely unhygienic and unacceptable.To be honest, I was deeply disappointed by the hotel’s failure to maintain even basic standards of professionalism and hygiene, let alone the expectations of a four-star establishment.I sincerely hope the hotel improves its professionalism and, most importantly, its basic hygiene. I had planned to stay again due to its convenient location near Shwedagon Pagoda, but my experience made me reconsider."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Lin Latt Htun"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXNN4TJeWej7D7EsLXEUn_ECg_6k9f8LGJh_qg7WRntgjN3I70j=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Room is clean and well organized.

It was a convenient, comfortable and pleasant stay. ||The room was spacious, very clean, well furnished and provided with an electric kettle, a hospitality tray (bags of green tea), bottled water and a chargeable minibar (mini fridge). It was not a standard double room; so it had a walk-in shower/ wet room instead of a bath. The extractor fan worked very slowly but it did not disrupt my daily plans. Electricity was reliable to use the air conditioning throughout the night. Internet was slow but usable to keep in touch with the world. ||Restaurant on the ground floor was small but served nice and inexpensive Chinese and Burmese dishes. I had no tummy ache! A limited variety of local breakfast was served at 7 am and continental  breakfast (cornflakes and milk, fresh fruits, juice, filtered coffee) was also available. You could order food 24 hours a day as well!||There is a spa (I had no time to try it) and a laundry service (it did the basic job). An ATM is just at the front of the hotel. The hotel's vehicle is a 7-seater, with air conditioning, which you can hire at a very reasonable price especially if you're travelling in a group of more than 3 (the max number to fit in comfortably a taxi). It takes at least an hour, due to worsening traffic jams, to get to the city centre and usual tourist attractions. ||Staff were very polite, attentive and always willing to help. Many showed a good knowledge of the local area. The owner and manager were extremely pleasant and helpful and keen to improve the quality of service that their hotel provides. ||It is a new hotel in the outskirts of Yangon which used to be a poor suburb built about 50 years ago. It is only about 10 minutes taxi ride from a big and busy shopping mall called \""Capital\"", a restaurant chain called \""Shwe Pazun\"" and a park where demo ethnic villages are built for local visitors as well as tourists (there is a fee which I don't know). The traffic on the road in front was busy in the day but it died down as the night went by. ||All in all, it offers a very good value for money if you are a customer with realistic expectations and wants an all-in-one inexpensive stop in Yangon.

Chose this hotel primarily for the location to wander in and around the characterful backstreets that fill out the spaces between Chinatown and the Colonial waterfront. The location didn't disappoint, neither did the hotel experience, although I should say that given the choice I'm someone who prefers functional to over-embellished rooms; the rooftop restaurant for breakfasts at sunrise and a drink near sundown were well worth the compact rooms. Staff were helpful and responsive, so definitely not a bad place to stay.  If you're looking to spend more time in your room rather than venturing out and exploring then it might not be the place for you.

Natural light has access to the guest rooms and that was my first priority. I liked their welcome fruit platter. In the past I did not get such a treat from other, more expensive hotels in the area. Complimentary breakfast is good. My guest room had all amenities that I needed, including a kettle and plenty of complimentary drinking water bottles and tea/coffee sachets. I liked the wall clock, which gave me a feel that I am in my home. The internet connectivity is good. I only wish that they had a built in wall light in the desk area.

The shower head was mounted below chest level. I brought these issues up with the staff on day 1, but there was no change during our time there.||Finally, the free breakfast. It was next door in a busy restaurant. There is a choice of 4 set menus with no changes allowed (it is not a buffet). Most hotels (every one we have stayed at in Yangon) have a buffet. The restaurant wouldn't even give us water, only tea or coffee (which I doubt is from filtered water). The water at the hotel is turbid (a light brown color), and I imagine that is what you get with the tea/coffee.||We brought our own bottled every morning which was not a problem.||I would give details about the number of flies in the restaurant, but suffice it to say that if you dont like flies buzzing everywhere, you might want to avoid the place.||The location (walking distance to the lake) was ok. A longer walk to other restaurants (with the exception of a Thai restaurant just across the street which was excellent).||All in all, I'd like to give it 3 stars. The house is nice. They could quickly fix most issues.

While the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, there were some aspects of the stay that left me with mixed feelings.\n\nOne commendable aspect was the staff's effort in acquainting us with the current restrictions in Yangon, which was much appreciated. Additionally, the hotel's location was a highlight, conveniently close to the colonial building point and only a short 10-minute walk away.\n\nHowever, there were several recommendations I would like to make for the management and future guests:\n\n1. Room Type Discrepancy: Despite booking a double room, I was informed upon arrival that this room type was not available. As a result, I had to pay for an extra bed, which was disappointing and inconvenient.\n\n2. Breakfast : The breakfast provided was quite basic, consisting of only 1 coffee, 2 toasts, and 1 egg. It did not meet my expectations for a satisfying morning meal.\n\n3. Room Condition: The private room I stayed in could use some improvement. The roller blinds were old and torn, the room had a musty smell, and the shower in the private bathroom was disappointingly weak, leading me to opt for the shared bathroom instead.\n\n4. Stairs and Elevators: It's worth noting that most small or medium-sized hotels/hostels in Myanmar have high/steep stairs and no elevators. Guests should be aware of this when making their reservations to avoid any surprises.\n\nDespite these concerns, the highlight of the stay was undoubtedly the exceptional staff. Their warmth and dedication were evident throughout, and I wish for them to continue enjoying their work and attracting more guests to the hotel."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mohd Zulkifli Hashim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVvZ3pOhfOTJy5xejPY_enqb3o0UYhWaNmsU-lzDcxJFh7FjYtr=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My first impression, HOOD was good especially representing hospitality of Myanmar.\nWell explained by their staff about do and don’t for first timer visitor at Yangon/ Myanmar.\nThey’re very helpful, always smiling and ready to help any guest they can.\n\nMinimalist concept was good and gives more room to others.\nBut a few item need to change because some tear.\nAnyway I just don’t like they promo too much about rainbow flag group.\n\nAny safety, don’t worry because they work 24hours and at the end of the road, security control for whole neighborhoods.\n\nRecommended to stay but not for the rainbow flag too much."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM-KBoZnlQf1xN-7f4r6nfF2PzdRPR9PVxrxlNi\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b23d54ce72d80f1""],""When"":""2025-1-1""},{""Name"":""陳威綸"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJT8LJyESxO0Lr6A0BAo_t598ob-0teoDmfLTzeYTTcVMDFZg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Power outage happened when I came in tonight, which led to no tap water available for shower and anything else.

The hotel staff are the biggest asset the hotel has because every single member of staff was very polite and friendly. The pool is outdoor and very handy for a swim. Food is varied and a freshly made omelette together with lovely fresh bread is a welcome western style breakfast. Room on second floor is preferable as music can be loud on upper floors at night.

The Chinese food available in the restaurant near Reception is nice and very generous portions too.This hotel is good value for money but you will have to travel further in a taxi to get a range of restaurants and shopping.

However, the lower floors are fine, and easy to cancel out remaining noise by using the AC. Be also careful not taking the smoking room: the smoke smell is masked by use of mothballs. After return my wife ordered me to throw all the contents of my suitecase in the laundry because of the moth-ball smell. The European restaurant downstairs (next to the Chinese one) is quite favorite with expat families that like to have a burger or some other western food with the children.
