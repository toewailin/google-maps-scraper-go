Like they got limited varieties of food and most are cooked with too much oil which wasn't really good. The wifi was really TERRIBLE, one of the reasons why I had to change hotel. I also noticed like most taxi drivers in the city |Always have trouble locating the hotel, like in 3 different occasions the cabbies had to call the hotel for direction or some even got lost completely trying to find the hotel.|But other than this few setbacks at the hotel, I love the cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms are big and the staffs are super friendly and nice. Would definitely stay here again when next time I'm in Yangon."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""may (Deena)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWw16bij02lzmdoh_BexSoLh12kH-wqPj79ll1IVCoWFzNlC_yV=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""2nd floor has body massage for 1.5hr 25000."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Thant Z"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0QeCck1CfANpZm9bBk3PHtP97Kh9k25HZfvq9yAWlN3BaIyjSHUPEfWkhAJmuYiJsH-_6g=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""New hotel with clean and room is spacious enough.

It was next door in a busy restaurant. There is a choice of 4 set menus with no changes allowed (it is not a buffet). Most hotels (every one we have stayed at in Yangon) have a buffet. The restaurant wouldn't even give us water, only tea or coffee (which I doubt is from filtered water). The water at the hotel is turbid (a light brown color), and I imagine that is what you get with the tea/coffee.||We brought our own bottled every morning which was not a problem.||I would give details about the number of flies in the restaurant, but suffice it to say that if you dont like flies buzzing everywhere, you might want to avoid the place.||The location (walking distance to the lake) was ok.

The rooms are clean and maintained well. They even have an ATM in the lobby. There is a 24hour CityMart (local supermarket) nearby. Since the hotel is on the main road, you can easily get Grab (like Uber car sharing service) and go around the city.\n\nDo read my previous review below:\n\n*****************************\nOld review from 2017 below:\n\nWe stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in the Superior twin room and 2 nights in the Junior Suite B with Bathtub. As most of the reviews have already mentioned,  choose the rooms towards the back of the hotel (away from the road) and preferably to the right (facing east), these rooms have a better view and also you will get a glimpse of the rising sun. The hotel's buffet breakfast is great and each day they have a special local cuisine. This, in my opinion, would be a very safe way to try out the local dishes. The staff can speak English and are very friendly. The rooms are clean and we'll  maintained. The only problem is  that the doors do not appear to be sound proof and could be a problem if there are a lot of guests moving in-and-out of their rooms. TIP: There is a City Mart outlet straight down the road, about 15mins walk. There is a hospital nearby. There are some great food places in about 15mins walk.

The most important thing to know going in is that this is a fairly small hotel. The lobby is quite compact, and even though there is a couch there usually are 2-4 people hanging out (I could never tell if they were all hotel employees or just friends). ||||For both stays I was given room #8004, right around the corner from the front desk. It might be the largest room in the hotel - there was a big, flat-screen TV, some comfortable chairs, a twin bed, and a double bed. The air conditioning was pretty strong but could be adjusted with the remote. For the first 3-4 nights there were a couple of mosquitoes that had gotten into my room somehow which made sleeping a bit difficult (I tend to attract them) in spite of the A/C being on.||||The bathroom is small but totally functional. I appreciated the modern fixtures, especially the square-shaped sink with a fairly deep basin. No problems with hot water or water pressure.||||Breakfast is served on the roof where there is an indoor eating area as well as outdoor tables. The manager, U Shwe (Mr. Gold), has done a nice job turning the outdoor space into something of a sanctuary by stringing vines and plants over the balcony so that you don't really see the busy and dusty street below. It's very green and pretty comfortable, but it's the only place to \""hang out\"" and is not free from mosquitoes since it's outside.||||The choices at breakfast are quite diverse and do rotate, so if you stay for a few days you'll see different dishes. Mostly Myanmar-style food with rice, noodles (usually oily), vegetables, soup, a couple of meat dishes, etc. though there is fruit and a couple of different bread products with butter and jam. U Shwe is always at breakfast and does a great job making guests feel at home, even to the point of plating food for them and bringing it to the table. His English is excellent and he's very helpful, so if you have any questions and/or need assistance of any kind be sure to seek him out.||||The location of this hotel is a half-block off of a busy street (Yadanar Road) that doesn't have a sidewalk and isn't really walkable. There is a Chinese/Thai-style restaurant just half a block up that is a good option if you don't want to eat at the Royal Ruby. It's on the same side of the street and serves decent food. ||||There is free wi-fi at the Royal Ruby, but as is often the case in Myanmar the connection seems to go in and out randomly. I was unable to connect with my iPhone but had no problem with my laptop, and in the mornings (before 9am) and evenings (after 7pm) the connection on my laptop was pretty good.||||The only reason I stayed at this hotel was because it is close to the offices of the organization that hosted me during my stay. It's not one that I normally would choose for myself, but it was perfectly adequate for most of my needs. Since there is no fitness center I took a taxi to Real Fitness on Pale Road just west of Kabar Aye Pagoda Road in Bahan. They charge US$20 for a session during weekdays and US$30 on weekends...pretty steep, but I really needed a workout.||||If I go back to Yangon and need to be in this part of town, I most likely would choose to stay at the Sedona Hotel. If you need something a bit on the cheaper side, though, the Royal Ruby should work for your needs. My room was US$60/night (payable in cash, even though there's a MasterCard sign at the reception desk) which apparently is standard for that class of hotel in Yangon. The best thing about the Royal Ruby is U Shwe - I wouldn't even have bothered reviewing this property if he hadn't been such a great resource.||||P.S. I left a piece of luggage at the hotel while I traveled to Inle Lake and Bagan and stopped by to pick it up five days later. No problem with that."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mel G"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0Qf66pF81jsVXBxevYxxL5FsdlDsKAngAUpJVE-hAwai1rl8J0QnYqktKV3UGdpbmNlc_A=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""The royal Ruby is anew hotel just a year old, it has 39 rooms, the receptionist speaks workable English and the manager check every room for cleanliness everyday twice he insists and as I seem home running around checking things and training his new staff one and half hours every day it's a bit like being in hotel training school as everyone tries to help in this B and B trying to go up market. I had difficulty trying to organise flights on the Internet to Mruak U and after the receptionist used the phone a friend option a taxi driver with good English turned up and drove me to the airline office and a money changing shop to get the best rate which it was it turned out. The rooms are spotless with that Asian guesthouse eyesore to most westeners the wet bathroom. Yep when you use the shower if you can stop splashing the toilet if you stand up western shower not squat Asian wash style. I was the only non Asian in the place. They gave me a said count for travelling alone, I didn't,t ask for it. There is the mini bar and flat screen and individual air on unit that was all working as we'll as power adapter and multipoint charging station. Free wifi and about dial in speed which I think is not their limitation. Breakfast is certainly set up for Asian with the congee soup, noodles and there is always the eggs and toast to fall back on. The Asian sweetened bread is not my cup of tea so perhaps I should have stuck to the local fare but wanted to try the western option. There is a very good oriental restaurant about fifty yards away with dim sum on Sunday and some of the best and fastest food service for an experienced foodie. No pool or gym only it's own dining room but clean safe secure and cooperative. A cab ride to town is cheap the driver they organised with good English took me for the days travel for not much more than my original rip off airport connection. I suspect the owner is still a general so you can't get away from that.

The hotel is located about 45 minutes drive from airport but the taxi fare was very reasonable at 8,000 Khat. which worked out at about 6 Euro. The hotel is not near the town centre but taxis are cheap so it was not a problem. It is however near the big Pagoda which you can view after a short walk. The hotel staff are the biggest asset the hotel has because every single member of staff was very polite and friendly. The pool is outdoor and very handy for a swim. Food is varied and a freshly made omelette together with lovely fresh bread is a welcome western style breakfast. Room on second floor is preferable as music can be loud on upper floors at night. I Definitely would recommend a head and shoulder massage in this hotel as it left me feeling great by a lady who had strength which belied her small frame. The Chinese food available in the restaurant near Reception is nice and very generous portions too.This hotel is good value for money but you will have to travel further in a taxi to get a range of restaurants and shopping. A rule of thumb is about 3,000 Khat for any taxi journey to town.  The smiling and very helpful staff made our stay a nice one.

The hotel is quite nice, and rooms are spacious and clean. I noticed that the higher rooms are not appropriate for jet-lagged people as the noise from the Karaoke bar (7th floor) penetrates through the building. However, the lower floors are fine, and easy to cancel out remaining noise by using the AC. Be also careful not taking the smoking room: the smoke smell is masked by use of mothballs. After return my wife ordered me to throw all the contents of my suitecase in the laundry because of the moth-ball smell. The European restaurant downstairs (next to the Chinese one) is quite favorite with expat families that like to have a burger or some other western food with the children. The breakfast in this hotel is not very exciting, but adequate (both western and Asian)."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

We checked-in around 3PM. Says you can check-in starting at 2PM. But when we arrived, the room wasn't quite ready yet. They were still fixing the water heater. They informed us that we'll be able to use hot water by night-time. The Side Table and Stools weren't even arranged properly when we arrived. We specifically requested the lake view room but was allocated at the 5th floor where the lake can't be seen as it's covered by trees. Still we get the view of Shwedagon Pagoda though. The room was hot, humid and a bit dusty when we checked in. Bed sheets are stained in some places but we didn't complain. What I was disgusted most by is the mold in Shower Curtains. Yuck! And hair remains in the bathtub and floor near the bed. At night, I turned on hot water and all I got was air, rusted brown water and cold water. I called them to check and they came in claiming the water is usable and is warm. It wasn't. Don't let me start with the room key card... Works 1 out of 30 tries. They came to change batteries both in the evening and the next morning. Every time we get out of the room we get locked out even though we have the key card with us. The only good thing was the tasty breakfast with a wide variety to choose from. Even for breakfast, the dining room arrangement sucked. They put two extra tables and chairs close to the buffet table and we have to tuck through these to get the food. Ugh... And they rang the doorbell at 7 AM mistakenly with the next room who were to check-out that morning. Didn't even say they were sorry for the interruption. We were given breakfast tickets but when we arrived at the dining room, no one was there to collect it so we left these tickets on the table after we were done eating. Guess what? They called us at 9AM and said it was the last call for breakfast. Good that they remind us for Breakfast, bad that they suck at who has finished eating and who have not. Overall, it seems overrated and overpriced compared to other hotels in town. Maybe they treat us locals differently from foreigners, not sure about that, as the room rates for locals and foreigners are different. But I think, for the same price, there are many hotels out there that give better service and facilities than those provided here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOTjv-D6zKesrZz3a9TCruPYLhsrV5_JvBM9upK\u0026fid=0x0:0xf4763ad7a8ba89c5""],""When"":""2023-6-3""}]",

However, upon arrival, I was given a smoking room with a strong odor and a quilt cover stained with bright yellow urine marks. To make matters worse, the bathroom amenities were only set up for one person. When I requested additional items, the staff insisted that my booking was for a single guest. I had to show them proof from both my booking confirmation and the Trip.com request form before they only gave one additional toothbrush.Regarding non-smoking room, I again raised my concerns in the mid-afternoon, the receptionist informed me at around 8:30 PM that they could move me to another non-smoking room which I kindly declined because I dont have time to pack again as I am have other business meetings in that evening. Due to the overwhelming smoke smell and the unacceptable hygiene condition of the bedsheets, I was unable to sleep all night.As for the morning breakfast, I was once again disappointed by the poor service. I ordered an egg, but it was poorly prepared—its appearance was unappetising, almost resembling vomit. To make matters worse, when the restaurant staff brought it over, liquid from the eggs was dripping through their hands and onto the floor. It was extremely unhygienic and unacceptable.To be honest, I was deeply disappointed by the hotel’s failure to maintain even basic standards of professionalism and hygiene, let alone the expectations of a four-star establishment.I sincerely hope the hotel improves its professionalism and, most importantly, its basic hygiene.

In contrast my hotel room in the city centre was so small that the TV is mounted like 80cm from the bed and they have to put it near the ceiling to increase the distance. The rooms are very well furnished (best value for money IMHO) and bigger than the family room that I had booked at the nearby Crystal Palace Hotel. It is a modern hotel with card entry. If you stay at the hotel you get a 20% discount at the Spa and the ONLY treatment I would recommend is the traditional massage at 10,000 kyat before discount. The Monalisa Restaurant (Level 1) is actually excellent and reasonably priced that I ended having dinner there every night. The breakfast is not excellent but quite good. There is actually an omelette counter so you can have you eggs done in any way but I did not see any eggs swimming in grease.||While the Wifi is not great, the signal is relatively strong and it is actually better than most hotels in Myanmar.

Shwedagon is also within walking distance.Downtown and Kandawgyi Lake are also not far away.  ||The best thing about this hotel is the hot water. You get very hot water very fast, better than some 5 star hotels.||Try not to venture to the basement as it is a \""Love Tunnel\"" mostly for the local businessmen.
