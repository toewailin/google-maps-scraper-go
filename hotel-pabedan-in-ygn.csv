Wall crushing hammering and drilling noise was as loud as they are working around my room. It not different from staying in the middle of construction site.  I went down to reception, she said they will noisy during workday 10AM to 5PM (but on Saturday, when I check-out, they were still continuing the hammering). I asked reception, if there any available room on the higher floor. She said no. So, I send email to the booking app's customer service right away with video clip to show them how crazy was the construction noise. (See the uploaded clip) Agoda never contact back. Next day I have to contact agoda again, they responded and said that they did not receive my first email. I send them more video clips, then they managed the hotel to move me to 6th floor.   Agoda do not provide direct complain channel, but ask me to complain via themselves, the customer service.\n\nNew room on 6th is quite quiet from the construction noise on lower floors BUT the room was full of strong smoking odour. My cloth was smell like the room when I unpacked my luggage at home.  The shower curtain was horribly mouldy. In the second night, there was a young local couple trying to get into my room with the correct key card. They can unlock electronically but stuck with manual lock from the inside. I am not sure who else got into my room when I was away. There were safebox but without manual. The walkway on 6th floor was so dark with red lanterns hanging along the corridor. There were lot of activities by their local guests in the late night on 6th floor. Which imply that they might provide hour rent for local kingky visit during the night.\n\nLater I provided negative feedback for Agoda as they requested via email. They gave USD3.60 back to my agoda account. I feel like being slapped with USD 3.60. My short trip was impacted from the time I spent on this problem for 2 rounds, then I have to spend 2nd night in the tobacco odour room.\n\nCleanliness, I would give 0/5. The pillow on 4th floor still have odour from previous sweaty guest. The blanket and pillow covers does not look like freshly washed. The shower curtains on 6th floor were mouldy.\n\nLocation I would rate 4/5 but at the moment the government put barbwire and barricade on the road around the city hall at the south end of the one-way 33th street, where the hotel located.  All of taxi and grab ride denied getting into this road, so I had to walk to/from main road for taxi and grab.\n\nI did not expect anything luxury room form this cheap rent at all but the common-sense of the hotel were absence: 1. They just crushing the building wall without considering that their guests might spend some hours during daytime in the room away from Yangon heat. Even they want to crush the 3rd floor, they can avoid accepting any booking into 4th floor during construction period. 2. It is OK for the hotel to have room for smoking guests but must not book non-smoking guest into that room. 3. After typing no.2. I just suspicious about smoke detector in the room. Should I expect fire safety from cheap hotel when I have to stay on the 6th floor with permanently locked iron grill on the window?\n\nI told Agoda that the customers need to be informed about the noisy condition. After that on agoda, I see the hotel still discounting without informing about noisy condition."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPuEx4JM1pu0g4dsnDsaGBLwHlSKqaKTUz0v-LL\u0026fid=0x0:0x8270cede795c888a""],""When"":""2022-10-17""},{""Name"":""Pyae Pyae Aung"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6oqumeMsDq8FuzZH7k_YeBeA5Q5Q8jfcCNQ9VMCeCUzdNNBnB=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I never used to write bad comment.

The first hotel I booked at $20 per night was an absolute dive. I got out of there as quickly as I could! Walked into Hotel Bond having checked it out online, yes it was a higher price, but worth every penny. The staff were so welcoming when I turned up at 8 in the morning, got me settled into a room and even invited me to have breakfast. The staff carried my suitcase up the stairs and even with the shared bathroom, i never saw the other guest sharing the bathroom so there was no conflict there. The bathroom was excellent with a rainforest shower and a smaller shower head. My suggestions here would be to get some bigger shampoo and shower gel bottles, the tiny individual ones are a waste of plastic and in this case space given that it is a shared bathroom. Putting some floor mats for the bathroom would also be a good idea, 2-3 so each room can have their own.||The room was small but very comfortable and clean.||The breakfast was decent and the daily noodle dish was always vegetable only which is just perfect!||My only other recommendation would be large water refills. Whilst having large water bottles as well as small is a big step above most hotels, I would prefer to use no plastic at all.

The location didn't disappoint, neither did the hotel experience, although I should say that given the choice I'm someone who prefers functional to over-embellished rooms; the rooftop restaurant for breakfasts at sunrise and a drink near sundown were well worth the compact rooms. Staff were helpful and responsive, so definitely not a bad place to stay.  If you're looking to spend more time in your room rather than venturing out and exploring then it might not be the place for you.

The hotel looks like a 3 star hotel and we had some doubts when we went into the hotel lounge. Reaching the bar on top of level 12, we were greeted by a rather bare large rooftop with chairs and tables placed loosely. The bar is literally two simple tables with different alcohol bottles displayed on it. We didn't have much hope. But the view was great and we had a good view of the padoga and full moon, which was really nice. Ordered a mojito and it was not bad at all. In other countries, this will probably get two or three stars from me but given that it is in myanmar, I think the place deserves 4 stars. Just remember that this is still a relatively new emerging market and places are still not fully commercialize yet, which is the main point. Sit back, enjoy the view, sip the cocktail which is only usd2.5, and relax. I'm sure one day, this bar will go through dramatic transformation into a high end bar with proper chairs, deco and expensive cocktails but I truly like it the way it is now.

The place isn't really glitzy but it has a definite charm, perhaps as a recognition of quieter times in Yangon.  It is a must visit in Yangon.

In nearly 3 weeks in myanmar we stayed in various places, all of which we found great, even very cheap backpackers hostels with no warm water or mirror in the room. However, we do think you should get what you pay for and this place just doesn't make sense. ||positive things first: the hotel is well located, near some nice restaurants and cafes and not far from the shwedagon pagoda. And the wifi works well. ||Other than that, it really sucked. Was by far and away the worst hotel we stayed in, in an almost 3 week trip to Myanmar - and the most expensive!! (Slightly surpassing even a beach front bungalow at Ngapali!)||The hotel and its furniture and equipment are very very old with some ridiculous features, like none of the room or bathroom lights working unless the main light is on (which makes it hard when one person is awake and the other isn't), and an almost cute built- in radio set from the 70s at the very latest! ||bad smell in the room (of smoking, to which a bellboy was sent to spray some anti-odor all over the room...) and in the hallways (of ginger cooking or something like that) - both topped with a lingering scent of mold. Bath was uninviting to say the least. ||My friend came in late and accidentally  walked into a different room to discover that the key worked!! After which she tried a few more and apparently the magic key opened all the rooms she tried. Didn't really matter because the hotel was empty except for us - and rightfully so.||The reason we picked this hotel was because of the so-called rooftop bar, which turned out to be a poor guy standing in front of a small reception table stocked with some alcohol bottles,  and an entirely unimpressive view. Yes, you can see the Shwedagon pagoda but aside from that not much more. ||We know there is a supply-demand problem in Yangon which makes for a situation in which hotels don't need to try very hard and still have a steady flow of clients.

While the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, there were some aspects of the stay that left me with mixed feelings.\n\nOne commendable aspect was the staff's effort in acquainting us with the current restrictions in Yangon, which was much appreciated. Additionally, the hotel's location was a highlight, conveniently close to the colonial building point and only a short 10-minute walk away.\n\nHowever, there were several recommendations I would like to make for the management and future guests:\n\n1. Room Type Discrepancy: Despite booking a double room, I was informed upon arrival that this room type was not available. As a result, I had to pay for an extra bed, which was disappointing and inconvenient.\n\n2. Breakfast : The breakfast provided was quite basic, consisting of only 1 coffee, 2 toasts, and 1 egg. It did not meet my expectations for a satisfying morning meal.\n\n3. Room Condition: The private room I stayed in could use some improvement. The roller blinds were old and torn, the room had a musty smell, and the shower in the private bathroom was disappointingly weak, leading me to opt for the shared bathroom instead.\n\n4. Stairs and Elevators: It's worth noting that most small or medium-sized hotels/hostels in Myanmar have high/steep stairs and no elevators. Guests should be aware of this when making their reservations to avoid any surprises.\n\nDespite these concerns, the highlight of the stay was undoubtedly the exceptional staff. Their warmth and dedication were evident throughout, and I wish for them to continue enjoying their work and attracting more guests to the hotel."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Mohd Zulkifli Hashim"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVvZ3pOhfOTJy5xejPY_enqb3o0UYhWaNmsU-lzDcxJFh7FjYtr=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My first impression, HOOD was good especially representing hospitality of Myanmar.\nWell explained by their staff about do and don‚Äôt for first timer visitor at Yangon/ Myanmar.\nThey‚Äôre very helpful, always smiling and ready to help any guest they can.\n\nMinimalist concept was good and gives more room to others.\nBut a few item need to change because some tear.\nAnyway I just don‚Äôt like they promo too much about rainbow flag group.\n\nAny safety, don‚Äôt worry because they work 24hours and at the end of the road, security control for whole neighborhoods.\n\nRecommended to stay but not for the rainbow flag too much."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM-KBoZnlQf1xN-7f4r6nfF2PzdRPR9PVxrxlNi\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b23d54ce72d80f1""],""When"":""2025-1-1""},{""Name"":""Èô≥Â®ÅÁ∂∏"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJT8LJyESxO0Lr6A0BAo_t598ob-0teoDmfLTzeYTTcVMDFZg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Power outage happened when I came in tonight, which led to no tap water available for shower and anything else.

In fact the entire hotel is beautifully decorated with expensive interior design, plush furniture , deeply padded carpeting and expensive fittings.\n\nMy room is beautifully decorated with quality linens, a great mattress, and comfortable traditional- style furniture. The bathroom looks brand-new with high-end rain shower, good plumbing, and tile work and fittings which befit a five-star hotel.\n\nThe water pressure was always strong and the temperature never varied.\n\nThe price for the room is a great value at approximately 50 US dollars in May of 2023.\n\nI have slept well here during my three night stay.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotel does not have high occupancy and had a very empty feeling when I checked in. Partly because it's the low season and very hot. But also tourists are absent because of the political situation in Myanmar.\n\nA military coup has caused great instability and there is fighting raging throughout the country, although Rangoon itself seems free of violence.\n\nSo there is only The Veranda bar restaurant open for drinks and dining and I have only seen one other hotel guest when I went there.\n\nThe ATM was out of order when I went to use it. Other services the hotel used to offer are no longer available due to the lack of guests, and certain floors of the hotel have apparently been sealed closed.\n\nThe district surrounding the hotel did not seem safe to walk at night and this was confirmed to me by hotel staff.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is just so so, and not of a wide variety. However there are delicious jams, yoghurts, and The Omelette station provides nice tasty omelettes. Coffee is very good.\n\nI feel bad to point out the negatives, many of which are out of control of the hotel due to the circumstances of the country.\n\nYou'll need to download grab onto your phone in order to use taxi service because there's no public transit readily available.\n\nAlthough I really like this hotel, during my next visit I'll probably stay in an area which is conducive to walking to explore cafes shopping and nightlife."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNPgAi_sltOuTTPVl0wUhz2P1x3HhD5xipclMTg\u0026fid=0x0:0x4ffd61fdf8d14432""],""When"":""2023-5-10""},{""Name"":""zinmin smith"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVPw0AzUzCpsmxnkCBA6MJCZ8Z31j5s-dlNeFEvMSxXANZKVsA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""I stayed two nights in the Rose Garden  Hotel and  I love it, These hotels are so luxurious.

My stay now was from 4 to 14 December 2017. The reason I selected this hotel was on the first place because of the interesting location (at least for me). Yangon is gradually becoming a hellhole of traffic jams. However, taxis starting at M.G.M. hotel find easily their way as well to Pyay Road and the airport as to the city center. At the same time, the hotel is near to a number of green lanes where  one can still observe authentic Burmese daily life. As for the hotel itself, it's a place where you can feel at ease. The staff is friendly, polite and helpful. I knew from my previous stay that I should avoid sleeping in a room above the Karaoke bar on the second floor. I slept on the 8th floor, where at night it was quiet except for the barking of swerving groups of dogs. These dogs are very peaceful during the day but seemingly become aggressive when they form kind of gangs during the night. Breakfast at M.G.M. hotel is good and abundant. However, if you like the rice, noodles, vegetables, eggs, etc...  warm, rather enjoy them at 7 AM and not at 9 AM.  On the first floor there's a good Chinese restaurant, and around the hotel restaurants of all categories and prices abound. Just next door is the Japanese restaurant Doreen. There's foot massage available  just at the right side of the hotel and also at other places at walking distance. Walking briskly you can reach Scott Market and Sule Pagoda in the city center in less than half an hour. Guided by a Licensed Tour Guide (Than Than Htwe@Hannah), I needed more time, but I learned a lot about the history and heritage value of buildings in Chinatown and the Indian quarter. While working in my hotel room, I experienced that WIFI quality had much improved since 2015, but sometimes download speed was still too low."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Front door assistances are so helpful.. even helping me in across the busy street.\nThe wifi is always in need of fixing, I had exams during my holiday.\n\nThe staff services are worth staying there.

As an added bonus, the famous 999 Shan Noodle Shop is just 5mins away.¬†||Some trade-off for this location are:|No lift as other reviewers have pointed out, it is not possible to construct one due to the heritage structure. The stairs are really steep. Thankfully, the staff helped me with my backpack.||The crowd and pigeons perched outside the hotel does get very noisy at dawn and at night too, bring ear plugs for a restful sleep.|||This heritage hotel has much potential but the management need to put in more effort in upkeeping the hotel. For example, fixing the loose floor tiles in the room and the TV with no signal. Also, please do consider moving the electrical switches to the side of the bed and add a small table. I brought an electrical flask and wanted to boil water but it is so challenging to find a suitable spot.|||Tips:¬† Taxi to Bus Terminal cost 13,000 kyat (arranged by hotel)||Please leave at least 2h30mins before your departure time because the traffic condition is terrible. There are many T junction en route and each traffic stop can take a few mins to clear. The hotel staff told me it will take about 1h15mins. Thanks to the info gathered on TA, I left 2 hours ahead of my bus departure and I arrived just before the bus departs.¬†|||"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Michelle P"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0Qf66pF81jsVXBxevYxxL5FsdlDsKAngAUpJVE-hAwai1rl8J0QnYqktKV3UGdpbmNlc_A=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""We enjoyed the central location of this stylish and comfy hotel.

Due to the overwhelming smoke smell and the unacceptable hygiene condition of the bedsheets, I was unable to sleep all night.As for the morning breakfast, I was once again disappointed by the poor service. I ordered an egg, but it was poorly prepared‚Äîits appearance was unappetising, almost resembling vomit. To make matters worse, when the restaurant staff brought it over, liquid from the eggs was dripping through their hands and onto the floor.

Compared to ten months ago, the apartments have gotten a lot of wear and tear. Little things aren't working like the AC remote, the door lock was missing batteries, the water heater switch was gone. You can tell the unit isn't cleaned completely. This apt building is still pretty new but it's already gone downhill. I can imagine in a year or two it will be in really bad condition.\n\nAnother thing is that when I tried to check in they claimed I paid too low a rate on Agoda so they would not honor my reservation. They said they had told Agoda but I never received any cancellation. It's completely wrong to force guests to come to your hotel and then tell them they cannot check in. They cld have cancelled my booking or at least sent a message thru Agoda. After an hour of waiting Agoda finally agreed to cover the price difference but I wldn't trust booking this place as they don't seem to know what they are doing with online bookings. If they want 40usd or more a night for this place I don't think it's good value as you can get a 4 star hotel for that much in Yangon.\n\nOther than these issues, it's in a good location, there are two small shops downstairs to buy water and a couple restaurants I didn't try. It's in a development of many new apt buildings but most are unoccupied. You can walk to a nearby mall, huge park, or South to the central area or it's a $1 Grab ride."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Yuki San"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLzwG8uqoG2shcIbp8euWoWF7RD2Z9ltaS53e0xPOIFTlobcZM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""do not book this property on agoda. they do not honour their prices on agoda and will ask you for a higher rate. avoid at all costs."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""mohana krishna Ponna"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWsfs7PTn-kNb0eo76riEUm6DjD5JQQc9kh8SEJjYT6E5smRJ8Idw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best service apartment\nBetter than normal hotel rooms,"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ïù¥ÏßÄÌòÑ"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIyf9IMnC9BRaeuGNO0hems5a3N-h7Yxvv7cfNasW2A68eZPg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This hotel is excellent for its price.I fully recommend it as a residence.\nThe room has a living room, a toilet, a bathroom, a shower, everything"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""YAH YA"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0QuIudPBUsHB-Cs5QI-VYKbTiyW3W1affQ__RfkrAFX52xW8J=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""One of the Best Serviced Residence in Yangon City,\nReasonable price\n24 hours Electricity\nEnough Parking Space\nHigh Speed wifi\nClean n latest Toilet\nBig TV\nBig Refrigerator\n2 Air condition\nMicrowave n etc"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMfaqdHaTxKx2I1kH39gWe6an5SLxlqTUqIFBdZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x3bc9c85287c93e77""],""When"":""2024-2-4""},{""Name"":""Vladimir Pleshchenko"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVbSdf5l15y_Mrg9u5Wj98IHkPaBinXlF7Ni4ZCse3KYV5upEgG=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Satur Mercury"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVHFJGCCGhOfczUax4hZ8aw4eEwmGOa65CaF4mpsVvOj-Kld1k53A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very good"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPr-cfjpqgqUIs4ashE7I0TX9maqxBsuw__hKfZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x3bc9c85287c93e77""],""When"":""2024-12-26""},{""Name"":""Bimalangkar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV4wP91LfkXP--28B1r7_8zLNoTHIgiFawe8lgXq47xq089_U9z=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""It's quiet and has a nice atmosphere around."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMzmdLDFTzsRoGzr9RVjZtsdFmpVow-NLxAAuZl\u0026fid=0x0:0x3bc9c85287c93e77""],""When"":""2023-9-7""}]",
